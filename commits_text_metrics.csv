Simplify JnlpProtocolHandlerTest.Some of this is similar to the simplifications for NetworkLayerTest in e9c1af14. This test has also been hitting sporadic hangs / failures primarily on certain OSes etc. These mostly occur in preClose0() also. Similar to that test part of the solution here is to eliminate the repetition of the exact same test.As part of understanding and cleaning up this test I also made a major effort to remove other duplication. And to improve naming and clarity. The individual test methods were lengthy with lots of duplicated code making it hard to understand what they were doing. Indeed some of the tests didn t actually match their name / intention. I extracted out the commonality and tried to make it clearer the variation in each test.This test had continued testing all old versions of the JNLP protocol. There had been TODOs marked to remove them from this test. They ve been deprecated for a long time. Their implementations aren t quite behaving properly particularly when it comes to closing them down which causes contamination with testing the currently supported protocols. With Oracle deprecating JNLP entirely it s time to remove these protocols from this test.,extract,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Adding the LinkIndexUpdator which updates the LinkIndex (previously called LinkManager) in response to repository events. The RecordLinkExtractor now extracts links from link fields (still todo: blob fields).This still needs testcases but I stumbled upon some small but blocking issues with the repository.Secondary changes: adding queue mock package containing classes to fake queue operation (used by both indexer & linkmgmt tests) adding repo util for utility classes which are useful for multiple modules and are repository related (in contrast with the other util package which is not dependent on the lily repository)Also disabled the indexer in the root pom.xml so that the build runs.git svn id: svn+ssh://dev.outerthought.org/outerthought/lilyproject/projects/lily/trunk@3996 b80d95f8 e103 0410 bd55 e03a9dc29394,extract,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.75,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
import tool: allow inline field declarationsExtend the json import format to allow declaring field types embedded in record types. Thus it is no longer to require to declare field types up front in the fieldTypes section.An inline field type declaration is recognized by the prescence of the valueType attribute.

Extracted a very unecessary dependency on java.util.URI.  74.This is probably the bigest change everrefactored on the system. The URI classwas nested deep into the system for noreal reason. It was assumed that allbackends would have a URI scheme andthat we keep the URI at all times onall buckets. This was not the case andeverything from the Bucket model to thePathResolver had to be refactored.The change was made in the first placebecause glacier does not have a URIthat we can just call. Instead we wantto configure each backend with key valuesinstead of with URI s.This change to the system should alsomake it easier to transition intoa key value store since the abstractionfor transfering buckets is  give thisbucket this key and when I give youthe key again then give me back my bucket .,extract,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Process both orderings DVD and airThis is in service of Issue  169.Let s look at a few episodes of the show  Robot Chicken . (I refer to season and episode number information like  S08E14  as a  placement .)Episode Title DVD Placement Aired Placement                                           Western Hay Batch S08E12 S08E11Triple Hot Dog S08E13 S08E12Joel Hurwitz Returns S08E14 S08E13Hopefully Salt (none) S08E14Yogurt in a Bag (none) S08E15So if a user has a file  Robot Chicken S08E14.mp4  and the renaming rule says we should add the episode title to the filename which title should we add?Our answer as of now is it should be the former simply because we have a blanket policy of  prefer DVD ordering .So if we  prefer  DVD ordering should we look only at DVD placement? No some shows simply don t have any DVD information. Not every show gets released on DVD.But beyond that many shows as the Robot Chicken example shows have released some episodes on DVD but not others.What if we see  Robot Chicken S08E15.mp4 ? We still prefer DVD ordering but there is no episode with S08E15 as its DVD placement. But there is one with S08E15 as its regular placement. So we use that one. We *prefer* an episode that matches the season and episode number in its DVD ordering but we will fall back on the over the air placement if no episode meets the criteria.We implement this by building an index. Previously the process was: we iterate over all known episodes if it has a DVD placement we try adding it to the index at that place if it doesn t have DVD placement we try using the over the air placementSo  Western Hay Batch  would be entered into the index using its DVD placement S08E12. Since  Yogurt in a Bag  doesn t have a DVD placement it would be entered at S08E15.We would try to add  Joel Hurwitz Returns  to the index at S08E14 it s DVD placement. As for  Hopefully Salt  we would try to add it to the index using its  aired  placement S08E14.So there s a conflict. The behavior as of the previous release was we d  panic  log a message about the two conflicting episodes and put *neither* of them into the index.Note that such a conflict only happens when two episodes have the same preferred placement which only happens if one of them has a DVD placement and the other one doesn t. It does NOT happen every time that the DVD placement disagrees with the over the air placement. For example  Western Hay Batch  and  Triple Hot Dog  both could be mapped to S08E12 but S08E12 is not the *preferred* placement for  Triple Hot Dog  so there was no conflict.This commit introduces a class  EpisodeOptions . Now a placement is mapped to an instance of EpisodeOptions rather than just to a single Episode.Now when we iterate over every episode in Show we always add BOTH placements to the index: DVD and over the air. We don t reserve  over the air  for a fallback any more. And we remember which placement is which because the EpisodeOptions class preserves this information.Then when we look up an Episode in a Season we say whether we prefer the DVD ordering or air ordering. There is always a  fallback  when doing a get. You will get the ordering you asked for if such an episode is there but will get one from the other ordering if your requested ordering doesn t have an episode.As of now in the application we only  get  with a DVD preference but that may change in a future commit. (We are already able to get non DVD episodes in the test harness.)So going back to our example: this ensures a deterministic answer for S08E14: it will be the DVD S08E14 because that s currently the preference this also ensures a deterministic answer for S08E15: it will be the air S08E15 because no DVD S08E15 exists we now have functionality to extract  Hopefully Salt  as S08E14; it just isn t yet exposed to the userThe code would allow the same episode to be the only episode mapped at two different places in the index. It also would allow multiple episodes with the same placement even with the same ordering. Neither of these things should ever happen. But the code doesn t check for it and is prepared to handle it if that s the data we get from the provider.,extract,0,0,0,0,0.125,0,0.166666667,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.051282051,0,0.051282051,,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.333333333,0.333333333,0.666666667,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Example:  public PrefixAdderIterator implements Iterator<String> {    private final String prefix;   private final Iterator<String> iterator;   public PrefixAdderIterator(String prefix           Iterator<String> iterator) {     this.prefix   prefix;     this.iterator   iterator;   }   ...   public String next() {     return prefix+iterator.next();   }  ... }  rather than   List<String> prefixedKeys   new ArrayList<String>();  for (String key: keys) {   prefixedKeys.add(prefix+key);  }  Change Id: I15821983ea2ebd07fd98feeb968ce9fa578ded0b Reviewed on: http://review.couchbase.org/12283 Reviewed by: Ted Crossman <tedoc2000@gmail.com> Reviewed by: Matt Ingenthron <matt@couchbase.com> Tested by: Matt Ingenthron <matt@couchbase.com>,extract,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.025641026,0,0.025641026,,0,0.041666667,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.166666667,0.166666667,0.166666667,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Added ability to restrict tests that require provider to support cancel on connect.  The httpclient provider supports this  but the urlconnection provider does not.  To specify whether the filetransfer tests should expect that cancel on connect can be tested  specify the following system property:  org.eclipse.ecf.tests.filetransfer.cancelSupportedOnConnect  e.g.  Dorg.eclipse.ecf.tests.filetransfer.cancelSupportedOnConnect false  will *not* assume cancel on connect is supported.  The default is true (cancel on connect is expected to be supported).,extract,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.052631579,0.166666667,0.052631579,,,0,0,0.071428571,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"BISERVER 4509: Reorganizing the parameter processing of PRD/Report Viewer.  The report viewer no longer processes parameters locally  everything gets passed blindly to the server. The parameter xml is the only source of configuration the GWT application gets.   GWT side: We no longer use raw DOM trees to configure everything. Using DOMs is cumbersome and easy to mess up. A real object model exists now that accepts the new xml structure that is generated by the content generator.   Cleaned out loads of misaligned anonymous inner classes   its never good to use inner classes and then still have to rely on If then else streaks if the same can be achieved with smaller classes.  All parameter names are URL encoded now. Users outside the english language space tend to use their native character set for everything  including URL components.  Instead of hardcoding the error text color  lets use the stylesheet for it.  Server side: Added proper GWT client support by passing all client properties through the parameter system. Output targets are now used instead of output types. Output targets can be redefined by the user by declaring a parameter with the name of """"output target"""". Paginating parameter is no longer treated specially  the pagination mode will be activated if the HTML pageable output target is selected.  Autosubmit  autosubmitui and layout are part of the master report object now. Reports can be hidden.   Split the monolithic ContentGenerator into 4 separate classes  each dealing with exactly one request type. Separation of concerns is cool.  The various inner classes that could have been static are now top level classes.   If no output target is selected  the default for XActions is HTML stream  for content generator it is HTML page.   Staging Handler: The configuration for this can now be done via the master report (in addition to the existing URL or system default settings). If the staging mode is set to memory or temp file  we now disable the ForceBufferedWriting mode of the HTML export. Be aware that staging in the current implementation causes extra memory consumption for output types that could have been streamed to the user (ie all except bufferd HTML).   Open points:  The parameter attributes passed to the client side are not namespace aware yet. The date parameter handling must still be fixed as it is broken for time and timestamp types in Bi Server 3.5.2 and 3.6.0.

"JCBC 992: DNS SRV workaround when IPv6 nameserver  Motivation:             The Bootstrap class  used to bootstrap the SDK from a DNS SRV record  relies on the default host machine DNS resolution. In the case where the DNS server list configured in the host machine include IPv6 entries  the whole initialization breaks and there s no way of using a different resolution process.  Modifications:                An additional overload for Bootstrap is added that accepts a nameserver IP (should be an IPv4)  to use with the """"dns://"""" prefix for direct name resolution instead of attempting to compile a list of name servers from the OS.  The Bootstrap test has been amended to use this feature and rely on Google s public DNS (""""8.8.8.8"""").  Results:          Bootstrap test pass even on a machine where IPv6 name servers are configured. Such OS configurations can be worked around by providing an explicit name server address  if needed.

Allow request params and options to be overridden on `autoPagingIterator`  We normally pass params and options with the `list` method:      invoices   Invoice.list(params  options).autoPagingIterable()  This patch adds support for them to also be overridden from `autoPagingIterator`:      invoices   Invoice.list().autoPagingIterable(params  options)  The reason for this is to support custom params and options for subcollections  which unfortunately do not inherit options from their parent collections. For example:      lineItems   invoice.getLines().autoPagingIterable(params  options)  There s more context for this in  264  and I tried a more elegant solution (which failed) in  269. This seems like the easiest option for the time being  with the possibility that we could do something more sophisticated later to start consolidating our interfaces.

Hopefully the last of the big exceptions refactorings. I went through all of the places we re adding context to our Errors object and made sure we re never doubling up    specifing the same injection point or key multiple times.  The new errors have nice  at  lines for parameters  fields and linked bindings. Hopefully this makes it easier to follow the stacktraces. Additional context (such as the binding s origin in a module) could be added later if desired. Currently we have module specific sources in CreationExceptions  and plain old binding sources elsewhere.

Fixes  81 HyperLogLog.Builder improvements  We cannot make the constructors for the Builder match HyperLogLog without risking behavior changes downstream  but we also have no default constructor for either (and adding one could be contentious).  Therefore I have added static  with  methods. This somewhat goes against the expected builder pattern  but it s not as though HyperLogLog.Builder was really following it anyway (there is only one setting so it is closer to just being a supplier).  Additionally  it would have been a little silly to also implement non static  with  methods since the code would look exactly the same for both.

updated flow latency analysis stuff. We now have an explicit report entry element for sampled latency. It is currently added by the component when it is sampling. This is separate from the processing latency. Will need to add it for the connection if the bus is sampling  i.e.  operates periodically. Added capability to generate report for Synchronous and Asynchronous. Synchronous does the reduced sampling latency by rounding up rather than adding the full sampling latnecy. It does so by adding the difference needed to round up.,extract,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.045454545,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Introduce field level metadata.  Changes include:  * Added Metadata (immutable) and MetadataBuilder to API. Opted to make these concrete objects (which the other builders are in fact not).  * Record extended with metadata get/set methods  * read/write path support for metadata     * for fields without metadata  storage format stays the same     * 3 bits of the prefix byte are used to indicate the metadata serialization version and at the same time the prescence of metadata (000   no metadata). See new class FieldFlags were it s documented.     * metadata not supported for versioned mutable fields (matter of saving implementation time on something that probably has little value)     * read always decodes the metadata (if this would be a problem  we can make loading metadata optional and/or do the decoding lazily)  * Added metadata to binary record serialization which goes over avro (bumped serialization version number),extract,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

JCBC 755: implement rest of N1QL tutorial and adapt DSL  Motivation            Continuing work from JCBC 750  implementing rest of the steps from the N1QL tutorial into SelectDslSmokeTest  and adding missing operators or functions in the DSL along the way. Note that 3 steps make use of DML which will be covered later.  Modifications               Added remaining steps from tutorial to smoke tests.  GroupByPath can now directly use identifiers in String form.  Modified KeyPath so that distinction between a String constant key vs an identifier key is more explicit (constant keys: xxxKeysValues methods).  Added sum and distinct functions in AggregateFunctions.  Added DateFunctions (with strToMillis  datePartStr)  NumberFunctions (moved round there from Functions)  StringFunctions (with lower and substr).  In Expression  added x method to convert a statement  sub method to convert a statement as a sub statement between parenthesis  path method to construct a path from Expressions separated with dots. Added arithmetic operators add  subtract  multiply and divide.  Added a Case mini DSL for case and case search expressions (eg. CASE a.id WHEN b.subid THEN 1 ELSE 0 END).

"Rewrite substitution resolver  use explicit immutable ResolveSource  The immediate motivation here was to fix  177  which this does  but in this commit a couple of existing test cases are broken in a way which seems to relate to order of resolution and resolve memoization. So we need to layer on to this commit better solutions for caching and cycle detection to get rid of yet more mutable state.  The previous setup used a side effect based lookup table of """"replacement"""" values to conceptually modify the tree without actually modifying it. Unfortunately that setup was hacky and hard to reason about and  apparently  broken in cases such as  177.  This new setup actually creates a modified tree and passes it around explicitly instead of inside ResolveContext.  In this commit  ResolveContext still unfortunately has a mutable cache and a mutable table of """"cycle markers."""" Both of those in theory could also be replaced by simply modifying the tree.  The main downside to this commit   and to cleaning up the remaining mutable state   is that we re using Java collections which have to be copied wholesale for every mutation (they are not persistent functional data structures). This will have an unknown performance impact  though in a sane world Config.resolve() is not a bottleneck in anyone s production app.  Some other details of this commit:   * resolve concerns removed from peekPath in AbstractConfigObject    and relocated into ResolveSource  * recursive resolution removed from lookupSubst and moved to    ConfigReference  * new hasDescendant() method used only in debug tracing     it is grossly inefficient to ever call this full tree    traversal  * new replaceChild() method is inefficient due to Java    collections but could in theory be made efficient  * most complexity relates to always knowing the parent of    a node that we might have to replace  so we can walk    up replacing it in its ancestor chain  TODO in subsequent commits:   * fix failing test cases  * we cannot replaceChild if we are a descendant of ConfigConcatenation     but we probably (?) need to be able to; consider / fix this  * instead of memoizing resolve results in a hash table  just    continuously modify the ResolveSource to have the most recent    results  * instead of using the """"cycle markers"""" table  change the    ConfigReference to a cycle detector value ",extract,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"exploit new  sourcepath option   removed all """"guessing"""": no more guessing of members  classes and type casts (removed the corresponding compiler options too). The """"downside"""" is that all imports must be accessible and  parseable at compile time. This means that we will also need something like a  classpath before we can use this inside our maven plugin to resolve dependencies on Jangaroo libraries. The upside: jooc warnings should be taken seriously now! Splitted analyze() phase into scope() and analyze() changed parser to parse dotted identifier sequences as QalifiedIde and increased priority of new operator to be higher than dot: new a.b.c().d is now correctly parsed as dot(new(ideexpr(qide(""""a.b.c""""))) """"d"""") handled all code generation for qualified and unqualified ide expressions in Ide and QualifiedIde generateCodeAsExpr()   no more tree rewriting in DotExpr and elsewhere (i think we can remove the parent node slot in AstNodes and change the return type of analyze() to void code generation now adds the package prefix for imported identifiers and the $$private prefix for private static members.

Even more performance issues fixed. I do not guarantee there are no bugs in this build ;). Status of what else needs to be done will be assessed later on. What has changed:  1. If EVERY protection is inside of the cache  it is safe to assume that any block NOT in the cache  IS NOT in the database.    We leverage this fact heavily in this build to give a significant boost to performance. 2. Caches. Cache ALL the computations. Numerous caches have been added in various places where specific points of bad performance    was located at. These caches generally only store computationally expensive calls; overall this is also significant after the    caches are nice and toasty. 3. Modules   before  LWC s own module system would broadcast events to every registered module. This added a overhead of about    1k nanoseconds per module  if they didn t override the method. This has been changed to detect at runtime what methods    they have overrided and then ONLY send events to modules that have them overridden. We could have modules register what    events they use but this would break backwards compatibility with plugins that hook into LWC. This uses reflection but    is all done on startup so the overhead is minimal. The gains is fairly large and worthwhile.  There is still a potential to shave off even more precious cpu cycles but this will be assessed further once initial results are in.  For scope  here is some example values for events: timing is in nanoseconds   Event  |Before | After| Redstone |  22k  |  3k  | Interact | 100k  | 46k  |,extract,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

JENKINS 31164: Configurable issue priorityId  typeId and actionIdOnSuccess  Motivation:  When Jenkins creates a JIRA ticket the priority and type ids are hardcoded and may break ticket creation as noted in JENKINS 31164.  Modifications:  Allow the admin to configure issue priority id and type id from the Jenkins job configuration. Allow the admin to configure actionId on success which allows the plugin to automatically resolve or close tickets.

"Straightforward translation of FileMover to use java.nio.file.Path.  For the most part  just replace everything related to the moving of files  to use the nio equivalent.  This mostly applies to FileMover and FileUtilities.  Java makes it very easy to go back and forth  so for now  UIStarter and FileEpisode are still kind of """"based"""" on java.io.File  and just use File.toPath() and Path.toFile() to go back and forth.  Other changes:   try to clean up the progress label no matter what happens; previously it would sometimes be left behind as a gray blotch   change areSameDisk method to use FileStores; add javadoc comment about Paths needing to exist   FileUtilities.moveFile no longer happily overwrites its destination     It s true that we already checked that the destination file does not exist in UIStarter  when we re building the list of moves to do.  But things may have changed by the time moveFile gets around to running  especially if we have two files in the source location that map to the same destination file  creating a race condition.     I still don t think we can truly guarantee that no race condition can cause file loss  but it s far less likely now   use our logger in moveFile  rather than the gjt logger   use try with resources instead of IOUtilities.closeQuietly   eliminate canStop argument to moveFile  since we always passed in true ",extract,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.235294118,0,0,0,0,0,0.020408163,0,0.020408163,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,0.096385542,0,0,0,0,0
Adds the initial implementation of durareport storage reporting. More tests need to be added  but it is functional. After initialization  it will start a storage report and store it in the x duracloud admin space. Once the first report is complete  it will be available at http://host:port/durareport/storagereport (until there is a report  that URL will respond with a 404). While waiting for the report  you can GET http://host:port/durareport/storagereport/info for status. No scheduling is currently in place  but new reports can be kicked off with a POST to the first URL.  git svn id: https://svn.duraspace.org/duracloud/trunk@413 1005ed41 97cd 4a8f 848c be5b5fe45bcb,extract,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Massive refactors. This list isn't complete  but should give you an idea:  A) many things in lombok.eclipse moved to lombok.core to enable reuse with lombok.javac.  B) lombok.javac works now similarly to eclipse's model: We first make big ASTs that are bidirectionally traversable  then we walk through that for annotations.  C) Instead of getting an annotation instance  you now get an object that is more flexible and can e.g. give you class values in an enum as a string instead of a Class object  which may fail if that class isn't on the classpath of lombok.

Closes #201 Closes #203  Squashed commit of the following:  commit 15b7ec65280e25e59082224fd46285ac81b3f63d Author: John Jenkins <jojenki@cens.ucla.edu> Date:   Fri Mar 9 12:35:50 2012 -0800      Moved UserPersonal into UserInformation.      UserPersonal recorded the personal information about a user which was intimately tied to how users exist in our system. For that reason  UserPersonal is defined in UserInformation instead of being its own class. The overall structure has not changed.  commit 46e498a5634f35001e83c51b881fefa88f61c514 Author: John Jenkins <jojenki@cens.ucla.edu> Date:   Fri Mar 9 12:33:28 2012 -0800      Reworked and optimized user/search and user/read.      Restructured the code to correspond with the changes to the user and user_personal tables. Then  created a new way to query the information from the database. Finally  reworked how user/search and user/read validate and aggregate their data to reduce the database load.,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Attached is a patch that does the following:  1) improves performance of commit/rollback by reducing number of round trips to the server 2) uses 7.1 functionality for setting the transaction isolation level 3) backs out a patch from 11 days ago because that code failed to compile under jdk1.1  Details:  1)  The old code was doing the following for each commit:    commit    begin    set transaction isolation level xxx thus a call to commit was performing three round trips to the database.   The new code does this in one round trip as:    commit; begin; set transaction isolation level xxx  In a simple test program that performs 1000 transactions (where each transaction does one simple select inside that transaction) has the following before and after timings:  Client and Server on same machine  old         new ---         --- 1.877sec    1.405sec   25.1% improvement  Client and Server on different machines old         new ---         --- 4.184sec    2.927sec   34.3% improvement  (all timings are an average of four different runs)   2)  The driver was using 'set transaction isolation level xxx' at the begining of each transaction  instead of using the new 7.1 syntax of 'set session characteristics as transaction isolation level xxx' which only needs to be done once instead of for each transaction.  This is done conditionally (i.e. if server is 7.0 or older do the old behaviour  else do the new behaviour) to not break backward compatibility.  This also required the movement of some code to check/test database version numbers from the DatabaseMetaData object to the Connection object.  3) Finally while testing  I discovered that the code that was checked in   11 days ago actually didn't compile.  The code in the patch for Connection.setCatalog() used Properties.setProperty() which only exists in JDK1.2 or higher.  Thus compiling the JDBC1 driver failed as this method doesn't exist.  Thus I backed out that patch.   Barry Lind,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Misc improvements to (hbase|lily|solr)-test-fw:  - CleanupUtils: added a clone of HBaseAdmin.flush() method because it was leaking connections (chd3u  trunk is fixed).  - LilyLauncher: protect resetLilyState() method from concurrent execution  clean HBase connection used by CleanupUtil.  - Delete obsolete LilyTestUtility & LilyTestUtilityTest  - HBaseConnectionDisposer: removed lily.hbase.deleteConnections system property  we can delete the connections associated with just one Configuration object.  - LilyProxy/HBaseProxy/SolrProxy/LilyServerProxy: embedded mode: improve temp dir creation/assignment  - SolrLauncherService: remove obsolete lily.solrlauncher.war property  - Upgrade to newer Kauri snapshot that stops the FilesystemAlterationMonitor  otherwise we have an increasing number of these threads after repeatidly stopping/starting KauriRuntime in the same VM.  - Give names to some more threads  especially those created by executors. Mainly used for Netty  and Netty actually renames threads itself  so does not do much right now  though this behavior can be changed so left this in.  - SolrProxy/LilyProxy: make variant of start() method without schemaLocation arg (uses default solr schema).  - SolrProxy: close http connection manager on stop()  - SolrProxy: added method to change Solr schema after startup (writes schema + restarts Solr)  - LilyServerProxy: move methods to add index to there  and manage lifecycle of IndexerModel/ZooKeeper/LilyClient.   git-svn-id: svn+ssh://dev.outerthought.org/outerthought/lilyproject/trunk@4949 b80d95f8-e103-0410-bd55-e03a9dc29394,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Introduce call  call adapters  and the response type.  * `Call` is the mechanism for request execution. It encapsulates a single request action either synchronously or asynchronously  and can support canceling. * `CallAdapter` is a means of supporting a method return type other than `Call` (like RxJava's `Observable`) by adapting the `Call` instance into another instance. This change moves RxJava support into a sibling module which uses an adapter for supporting `Observable` types. * `Response` represents the HTTP response along side the deserialized body.

"First step towards a new settings system  Summary ======= Got rid of the settings enum  and replaced it by contants. This allows for type safety. Settings are now responsible for reading and writing their values  instead of tons of overloaded methods in ConfigFile. Added a few tests.  The Setting class ================= Each setting type now extends Setting<T>. The type parameter T is the type of the value of the setting  like String  Integer  Boolean  List<String> or even SurfaceGenerator. Each setting implements the methods """"T read(String)"""" and """"String write(T)"""". There's also a method called """"T getDefaultValue()"""".  ConfigFile changes ================== There are now two method left that read settings: """"<T> T readSettings(Setting<T> setting)"""" and another one that allows to override the default value from Setting.getDefaultValue: """"<T> T readSettings(Settings<T> setting  T defaultValue)"""". This is used by BiomeConfigs.  There is only one method left that writes settings: """"<T> void writeValue(Setting<T> setting  T value)"""". It simply calls the write method on the setting  and writes the result to a file.  The Settings factory class ========================== """"Settings"""" acts as a factory for creating settings. WorldStandardValues  BiomeStandardValues  etc. now extend this class  instead of implementing MultiTypedSetting  that has been removed. The classes are no longer an enum. Enums force all values to have the same type. Now the settings type are much more explicit.  The reason for creating factory methods instead of calling the constructor is that we may want to keep track of all settings in the future. The old settings enum provided this functionality  and the factory methods allow us to do so too.  Variable names ============== Constants are now UPPERCASE_LIKE_THIS  variables are now camelCase. In the settings file you will still see SettingsLikeThis. This can be done now that variable names and setting names have been split. Value enums (like TerrainMode) haven't been split yet  so they keep their variable names LikeThis for now.  Next steps ========== - Move the file reading/writing logic out of ConfigFile  so that settings can be read from different sources  like Mojang's new settings format used in the Customized world type. (http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Customized) - Remove all unused settings. This includes all structure settings of BO2 (support removed in TC 2.3  replaced with BO3 structures in TC 2.4) and the two color settings from the WorldConfig (support removed in TC 2.2  now handled by biomes) ",move,0.333333333,0.333333333,0,0,0.25,0.5,0.133333333,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.083333333,0,0.019607843,0.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.095238095,0.095238095,0.047619048,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Add the new provision exception API.  Guice currently has an Exception called ErrorsException that is used to signal certain kinds of errors.  The general strategy is either to * call Errors.addError if you come across an error but can keep going * call throw Errors.addError(...).toException() to report an error when you can't keep going  The second option throws an ErrorsException.  Which is then caught at various api boundaries.  The idea in this cl is to introduce a parallel API called InternalProvisionException which can take over the analogous usecases for provisioning time errors and ErrorsException will be preserved for configuration time errors. ErrorsException will be renamed to InternalConfigurationException after InternalProvisionException is fully integrated.  This also refactors Errors.java to move a bunch of static utilities for dealing with Message objects to a new class Messages  ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=177714992,move,0,0,0,0,0.0625,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rework FileMover.  This is pretty much a rewrite of UIStarter.renameFiles() and everything beneath it.  Introduce a new class  MoveRunner  to be the driver of individual file moves in the class FileMover. The UIStarter prepares a list of FileMovers  and creates the MoveRunner with that list of FileMovers.  The MoveRunner then executes the FileMovers.  Note that now  UIStarter no longer makes any reference to Files  Path  Paths  Callable  ExecutorService  Executors  or Future.  I think this is good.  Those classes were not part of the view.  Move copyAndDelete into FileMover.java  and make it a private instance method.  Now that it's private  it doesn't have to be so defensive about all the checking; it assumes its callers have verified everything is ready to go.,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rewrite RealOptionalBinder to use the InternalFactory interfaces and avoid the overheads of normal ProviderInstanceBindings + Providers.  A couple of notes on the implementation * all the mutable state (besides Binder) has been moved into a new helper object 'BindingSelection'.  I think by moving things into a helper object the interactions are a bit clearer.  This also allows us to make all the factories static. * calculating the keys + optional binder 'name' have been delayed until configure() time or until setDefault()/setBinding() is called.  I would assume that most optionalbinders are deduped or that setDefault()/setBinding() is not called  so we can avoid work in the common cases. * None of the factories need circular deps resolution because they simply delegate to other factories. (in this way they are much like the ProxyFactory used for LinkedKeyBindings  we just wrap the result in Optional) * I performed a minor refactoring the the java.util.Optional reflection helpers  Benchmark results: timeOptionalBinderInjection measures how long to inject an object that depends on other OptionalBinders in every configuration timeProvidesInjection times how long it takes to inject an @Provides method timeOptionalBinderSetBinding times how long it takes to directly inject an OptionalBinder.setBinding() binding that delegates to the same bindings as 'timeProvidesInjection'.  So we should be able to see the overhead of OptionalBinder to fetch the same object.  ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=130648042,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Post release refactor. I moved almost everything that was package-private in com.google.inject to the internal package. The motivation is to simplify things - the previous setup was extremely awkward because c.g.i could call into internal  but not the reverse. Similarly for the SPI package.  This refactoring reduces the visibility of many symbols in internal  and makes some other code hygeine changes.  Once this is checked in  it should be much easier to add the toConstructor() binding type. That was previously difficult because the ConstructorBindingImpl class was package private and intertwined with that package.  git-svn-id: https://google-guice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1002 d779f126-a31b-0410-b53b-1d3aecad763e,move,0.666666667,0.666666667,0.666666667,0.666666667,0.75,0.5,0.733333333,0,0,0,0,0,0.133333333,0,0,0,0,0,0.012048193,0,0.011904762,0,0,0,0,0.019607843,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Eliminate inner class from ShowName  QueryString previously was a static inner class in ShowName.  Move its functionality up to ShowName.  I guess the whole distinction was kind of a dumb idea.  Here's the dumb idea:  If we get two files like:   """"The Office S05E07.mp4""""   """"the.office.s06e20.mkv""""  ... I was thinking we should have separate ShowName objects for each  because the substrings we extract as the found show names are not identical:   """"The Office""""   """"the.office""""  However  their """"query strings"""" ARE identical.  So that's what the previous setup did: had them have separate ShowName objects while sharing a QueryString object.  I realized that was pretty pointless.  I do still think it's important to retain the actual found show; if something goes wrong with """"The Office S05E07.mp4""""  we don't want to say we had a problem parsing """"the.office""""  because that string does not even appear in the filename!  So  we do maintain the original  untouched string.  But  we maintain it in FileEpisode.  For the work we're doing here  we don't need to retain it.  Especially since  as I was reminded in a recent commit  the whole point is to NOT process both ShowNames.  Since they have the same query string  we only need to process one of them; that's why we had the query string in the first place.  So  to say either """"The Office"""" or """"the.office"""" failed is wrong  anyway.  It's really the query string that failed.  If we do mention one or the other  it's only as an *example* of a filename that gave us this problem.  So  we do still keep an """"example"""" found name along with the query string.  But we don't need separate show names  which means we'd have a 1-to-1 mapping between ShowNames and QueryStrings  which means they can just be the same object.

Move checkDestinationDirectory from UIStarter to ResultsTable  Now we call it when the UIStarter calls the ready() method of ResultsTable.  Also make the method synchronized.  It was probably a mistake that it didn't move to ResultsTable when we first broke out ResultsTable into its own file.  This was the only reason UIStarter had anything to do with UserPreferences  or in fact  anything to do with the model.  Now that we've moved this code  UIStarter doesn't depend on model at all (besides for Constants)  and is very generic.  With a few small changes  it could be used as a startup file for any graphic application.

ResourceMenu  * removed the getSelectedRef and setRefSelected methods  and made get/set Selected take WeakReferences as argument  Listener  * corrected deleteResource to properly delete all children of a group  Util  * added some static utility methods for WeakReference - deRef and refsAreEqual  Resource  * moved the node field from Ref to here  git-svn-id: https://lateralgm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lateralgm@218 8f422083-7f27-0410-bc82-93e204be8cd2,move,0,0,0,0,0.0625,0,0.066666667,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.060240964,0.294117647,0.05952381,0,0,0,0,0.098039216,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

deprecated MavenRuntimeManager and friends  At very least this API was misplaced  it should have been exposed from o.e.m2e.launch bundle  not from the core.

First work on introducing Lily record scanners: similar to hbase scanners but then to run over lily records. The lily record scanners connect directly to HBase  thus also from within LilyClient. Scanning thus bypasses the lily-server process  and hence also the avro interface. Changes include:  - moved code for decoding HBase Result objects into records to a class RecordDecoder  - publish hbase props to ZK as /lily/hbaseConfig as client needs it (will replace blob hbase access with that too). The pure (HBase|Remote)Repository implementations don't rely on ZooKeeper.   git-svn-id: svn+ssh://dev.outerthought.org/outerthought/lilyproject/branches/scanners@5391 b80d95f8-e103-0410-bd55-e03a9dc29394,move,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012048193,0,0.011904762,0,0,0,0,0.019607843,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.047619048,0,0.047619048,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Per-World Permissions and groups API and more ...  This API will make CanaryMod act as if everything is global by default. A plugin is required to change this behaviour to something else.  Groups can now have a world assigned (null if global) and permissions can be saved into separate tables (each world has a table) to determine which permission belong to what world. Additionally the global permissions are stored in permission table.  You can always access global settings by passing null as world. Otherwise the fully qualified world name is required which you can get from a world  by calling World.getFqName();  Also moved UnknownWorldException from implementation to Lib.  DataAccess now defines a getInstance() method  which needs to return a new instance of the current DataAccess. So if your DataAccess it MyDataAccess then getInstance() must return new MyDataAccess(). This is required to incorporate multiple tables per DataAccess (custom table names).  Changed the groupCreate command but it's still wip.,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Move javax.usb and native stuff into their own packages.

The javax.usb stuff is moved into the usb4java-javax project and the native JNI code is moved into the libusb4java project. Binary files are no longer present as Java resources.

409732 : Split lifecycle mapping analysis from project import  The Lifecycle Mapping analysis is now only run after projects are imported  making selection of projects to import much much faster (< 1 sec vs 1-2 min for the wildfly codebase and its 130 projects)  After import  lifecycle mapping error markers are collected on imported projects and the discovery service is invoked to find proposals fixing these errors.  Caveats : - no proposals are shown anymore in case projects import without errors  making discovery of new/other applicable connectors less obvious.  As part of the refactoring the following notable architectural changes were performed : - LM Analysis and Discovery proposals UI are moved to a dedicated Wizard. - LifecycleMappingConfiguration was deprecated in favor of   LifecycleMappingDiscoveryRequest   -Lifecycle Mapping discovery is now based on a collection of   ILifecycleMappingRequirement  Signed-off-by: Fred Bricon <fbricon@gmail.com>,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012048193,0,0.011904762,0,0,0,0,0.019607843,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A fix to an unfortunate  rare concurrency problem. During injector creation  it's possbile that an @Inject method will start a thread  and attempt to access injected members while the injector is still being created. The IdentityHashSet of members to inject is currently accessed  and everything blows up. Terrible!  The fix is somewhat involved so I moved it all to a new class  CreationTimeMemberInjector. It takes care of preventing other threads from accessing injected members until all such members have been injected.  git-svn-id: https://google-guice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@555 d779f126-a31b-0410-b53b-1d3aecad763e,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"pmd: refactor PMD main class (no functional change)  This refactor is focused on reducing the amount of responsibilities of the PMD class. Therefore all thread manbo-jambo has been moved to separate subpackage  and the algorithms associated to the mono threaded or multithreaded strategy were also moved into two separate classes. As they share a common signature and some code  an abstract class was also added.  A large amount of code were moved out of PMD class to a RulesetsFactory utility class  here again to reduce coupling and scope of responsibility. At last  PMD class now has two fields  the Configuration object  as before  and a new object called SourceCodeProcessor  which is in charge of ... processing source code !  Anyway  those changes are pure inner refactoring and should be harmless to project  such as PMDEclipse or the Maven plugin - however  as any good plan tends to go """"boum"""" the minute you state """"I love when I a plan come together""""  please let me know if you run into any issue with theses changes  I'll do my best to support you...  git-svn-id: https://pmd.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pmd/trunk@7465 51baf565-9d33-0410-a72c-fc3788e3496d ",move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Rewrite Multibinder to use the InternalFactory interfaces and avoid the overhead of normal ProviderInstanceBindings + ProviderLookups  This implementation follows the same pattern as OptionalBinder  notably * All the mutable state is moved into a new inner class named BindingSelection * Calculating keys + set names is delayed until configure()/initialization time * None of the factories need circular deps resolution   I did my best to mirror the structure of RealOptionalBinder instead of trying to maintain the preexisting structure  since i thought that having RealMultibinder implement Provider and Module was a little strange.  Let me know what you think.  Benchmark results This shows the cost of injection Set<T> and Collection<Provider<T>> for a multibinder containing 5 entries  So we save 2 objects  58 bytes and about 20ns per multibinder entry  which is less than i expected  ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=131599436,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.020833333,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

JCBC-855: Improve writability of integration tests  Motivation: ----------- When writing an integration test case that has special requirements (like a dedicated bucket  avoid the flush phase  use a different bucket name  ...)  it has become very difficult to rely on inheritance of ClusterDependentTest base class (as JUnit doesn't behave very well with abstract parent classes). There was a need for a different more flexible approach.  Modifications: -------------- Most of the code mutualized in ClusterDependentTest has been moved into a CouchbastTestContext class. This context holds the references to the Cluster  Bucket  BucketManager  etc...  It also provides utility methods to perfom assertions on the context (eg is N1QL available) and lifecycle management (cluster disconnect  ...).  Such a context should be created in a @BeforeClass method on each test case instead of it extending ClusterDependentTest  by using the CouchbaseTestContext.builder() builder.  ClusterDependentTest has been made deprecated and is mirroring the old behavior by relying on CouchbaseTestContext internally.  Thanks to that  tests that were previously ignored have been reactivated.  Results: -------- Using the CouchbaseTestContext with the associated builder allows for far more flexible integration tests. For example it is possible to set a specific bucket name then to have it being created in an adhoc way (by appending a timestamp to the given name)  so that it can be destroyed after the testcase.

Working on: MNG-662  o Moved release.properties management to a helper class o Created a helper class for caching/prompting for project-versions o Created a helper class for managing SCM info updates during the release:prepare process o Moved as many of the shared fields out of AbstractReleaseMojo as possible  given the refactor to reactorized processing o Refactored the PrepareReleaseMojo to process a list of projects  and resolve inter-dependencies during transforms  etc. o Refactored the PerformReleaseMojo to adjust to the new helper classes. o Removed the old transformers  since MavenProject.writeOriginalModel() can be used instead  using the modello writer o Bumped the maven-scm versions up to 1.0-alpha-2-SNAPSHOT  and added maven-scm-manager-plexus.    git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/components/trunk/maven-plugins@227148 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68,move,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0.266666667,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012048193,0.058823529,0.011904762,,0.105263158,0,0,0.019607843,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.047619048,0.047619048,0.047619048,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Redo substitution resolving to better handle complex cases.

By using partial resolution whenever possible  more interdependencies between substitutions are permitted.

[MECLIPSE-364] incorrect dependencies with different projectNameTemplates in submodules EclipsePlugin - Moved calculateProjectNameTemplate() to IdeUtils and parameterized. - IdeUtils.calculateProjectNameTemplate() is now called once in setup to set the value of projectNameTemplate   All previous uses of calculateProjectNameTemplate() now refer to getProjectNameTemplate() - getProjectNameForArifact() now checks if the project is in the reactor and uses getProjectNameTemplateForMavenProject() to    use that project's name template definition and not the current project's definition - getProjectNameTemplateForMavenProject() looks for the variables in the specified project pom and uses IdeUtils.calculateProjectNameTemplate() to return the project name template AbstractIdeSupportMojo - refactored isAvailableAsAReactorProject method body into getReactorProject which returns the project out of the reactor.   isAvailableAsAReactorProject justs checks for against null from getReactorProject - modified test project-34 to use projectNameTemplate   the side effect of this is that the generated classpath for the web app MANIFEST.MF uses the eclipse project name for the jar.  git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/plugins/trunk@727620 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0.157894737,0,0,0.058823529,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The viewer layer now has the correct bounds.  Previously  zooming in too far would stop showing the canvas. This came because of incorrect bounds. Now  we set the bounds of the viewer layer to the bounds of the grob. We have a special case for non-grob objects.  The viewer layer is now set using setOffset() instead of moved to the center in the drawing.  This can be further be optimized by not repainting the entire viewer but just the viewer layer. However  for that to work  the handles also need to be drawn inside of the bounds of the grob  which is not the case.,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0.013461538,0,0.01635514,0.00617284,0.016129032,0,0,0,0,0.017316017,0.020833333,0.013245033,0.024691358,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.001666667,0.020408163,0.022988506,0.01980198,0

Rewrite RealMapBinder to use InternalFactory  This CL is a performance refactor.  This does change the SPI dependency tree  in a way I believe more accurately describes the dependencies of each of the maps provided. Previously the dependencies for all maps was just a dependency on the entrySetBinder  which contained providers for all of the values. The new implementation has dependencies directly on the Vs for Map<K  V> and the multimap versions (e.g. Map<K  Set<V>>)  and dependencies on Provider<V> for Map<K  Provider<V>> and the mutimap versions (e.g. Map<K  Set<Provider<V>>>).  This implementation follows the same pattern as OptionalBinder  notably * All the mutable state is moved into a new inner class named BindingSelection * Calculating keys + set names is delayed until configure()/initialization time * None of the factories need circular deps resolution  Caliper benchmarks show an improvement in all four bindings provided by MapBinder: https://caliper.[].com/runs/280cbcdd-9853-46a6-9852-2d591fc8b848 bfa5c0d0-002a-4eaa-9984-d4ac459daf16#r:scenario.benchmarkSpec.methodName run.label (command used: [] run --run_under=perflab -- experimental/users/lukes/benchmarks:InjectionBenchmark -b timeMultimapBinderMultimapBinding timeMultimapBinderMultimapProviderBinding timeMultimapBinderMapBinding timeMultimapBinderMapProviderBinding -t 3 -r {head  with_change})  This has been run on the tap train and no failures are believed to be associated with this CL: []  ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=133630536,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0.153846154,0.010989011,0.175233645,0.018518519,0.161290323,0.043010753,0,0,0,0.121212121,0.184027778,0.039735099,0.290123457,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.003333333,0.255102041,0.287356322,0.306930693,0

Introduce a cleaner lower level API with the Console interface.  It provides a signal api  access to the underlying terminal capabilities and stty settings. It also brings support for virtual consoles when using remote connections for example.  It’s not much leveraged in the remaining of the code.  Things like cursor movements  etc.. should leverage this information. The AeshInputStream hacks for transforming windows arrow keys can be just removed  and it should also be noted that the AeshInputStream does not correctly handle the encoding of the input stream and assumes the default charset  which is always not the case  especially on windows.  The only external dependency on those 3 new packages (api  impl  utils) is the LoggerUtil class. This means that this can easily be extracted as the very-low component.,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

First stab at refactoring maven-archiver to provide file/directory permissions in a more general way in the api. This is necessary to make MNG-632 easier.  o Moved UnixStat a package higher in the tree; it was not only   used by ZipArchiver but also by TarArchiver. Now it's used in   AbstractArchiver.  o Moved the ZipArchiver default file/dir permissions constants   to AbstractArchiver.  o Deprecated some methods in ZipArchiver that are now in AbstractArchiver   (different name). Backwards compatible  ofcourse.  o Updated TarArchiver to synchronize TarOptions' dir/file mode   with the AbstractArchiver's versions. Made them deprecated.    o Added JUnit tests for ZipArchiver and TarArchiver to   test various permissions.  o Fixed coding style on some modified parts.  o Removed some unused imports/fields/local vars.  o Fixed some potential bugs  most notably no exceptions   thrown ( if (..) {  new ..Exception() } -> add 'throw' ).   and a case where the wrong key was used.

Improve BiomeGenerator and BiomeCache handling  The BiomeCache class has it's implementation moved to Common. Our cache is more efficient for our needs than Mojang's cache  as it can better handle virtual biomes. Our cache has very similar API to Mojang's cache for now.  Previously  there was a biome generator called VanillaBiomeGenerator that had to be special-cased. Now it's up to the implementation of TC-Common (either TC-Bukkit or TC-Forge) to register a vanilla biome generator that properly implements BiomeGenerator.  There is one area left where the VanillaBiomeGenerator should still be special-cased. [Bukkit/Forge]VanillaBiomeGenerator gets its information from Mojang's WorldChunkManager. The Biome(Gen)Base arrays are converted to int arrays. If you would use TCWorldChunkManager (extends WorldChunkManager) to get information from the BiomeGenerator  you would get infinite recursion.  To make the code more maintainable  a check has been added to the [Forge/Bukkit]VanillaBiomeGenerator classes (as well as documentation to the class).,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
major cleanup of the query api.  moved the query language syntax specific functions into the corresponding dialect implementations (finally).  thusly  we only need one query factory that just delegates all query lang specifc things to the dialect.  killed the subclasses of the factory.  killed the subclasses of RdfQuery  all that stuff also moved into the dialect.  then added an ARQ specific SPARQL dialect to support their special Bnode ID syntax.  this organization i think more closely aligns with the normal JPA stuff  and is a win for adding new rdf query language syntaxes.  also provided a work around for the namespaces stuff for when using EmpireUtil.all before ever using an Entitymanager.,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Move test method """"testDownloadAndRename"""".  The """"testDownloadAndRename"""" doesn't really rename anything.  It actually is a """"test download episode title"""" test.  As such  it's primarily testing the program's ability to look up shows and listings.  This is all dependent on the provider.  So it really much more belongs in TheTVDBProviderTest  rather than TVRenamerTest.  The method does also test TVRenamer.parseFilename  but that's redundant.  That's exactly what the method testParseFileName does  and testParseFileName does it better.  As a first step  I'm simply copying all the test data  and moving the test method  from TVRenamerTest into TheTVDBProviderTest.  This will be refined in future commits.

"IndexUpdater fix: when a record changes so that a different <include> rule from the indexerconf matches  a different set of vtags might become active  in such case deletes must be done on solr to remove the entries corresponding to the old vtags.  For the IndexUpdater to be able to do this  it needs to know what <include> rule matched before  hence it needs both the old & new record state. This is exactly the same as what we need for evaluating the IndexRecordFilter in the IndexAwareMQFeeder  and is put into RecordEvent by IndexSelectionRecordUpdateHook. Therefore  the information provided by this hook is now also useful for IndexUpdater.  Additionally  for update of denormalized data to work  records which are not indexed by themselves but are accessed through dereference expressions also need to be matched by the IndexRecordFilter. To be able to express this  we need to support include rules with empty vtags: <include {conditions} vtags=""""""""/>. This basically says: include the record  but don't index it. The same could be achieved by <match> rules to exclude the record from indexing  but that's more expensive (the recordfilter decision can be made without even loading the record) and (currently) doesn't help much with dynamic fields either.  Solving all this brought a couple of other changes with it:  * Refactored VTaggedRecord: moved out things which only dependend on RecordEvent (and not on a loaded Record) into RecordEventHelper. Probably could use further refactoring to completely split the two because now VTaggedRecord is also used in cases where there is no RecordEvent. (and then maybe reintroduce a third party to combine them).  * indexer-integration dropped: merged it with engine due to circular dependencies for their tests (engine test now needed the IndexRecordFilterHook). Could have been solved also by splitting indexer-integration into two different projects  but decided that it's ok to have it together with engine.  * Renamed RecordEvent.IndexSelection to RecordEvent.indexRecordFilterData  renamed IndexSelectionRecordUpdateHook to IndexRecordFilterHook.  * Fixed NPE in IndexRecordFilterHook in case of a record update where no record type is specified.  * Pulled out the code to create Record's from the information stored in RecordEvent into a new utility class (IndexRecordFilterUtil) so that it can be reused by IndexUpdater.  * IndexerTest now needs an IndexRecordFilterHook  which depends on IndexerModel which was previously not used in this test.

Add base classes for Parser implementations to eliminate duplicate code.  Also add a TokenManager wrapper interface and implementations for each Parser.  Ultimately this stuff needs to be moved into Language specific packages.  I expect further effort will need to be done to generalize anything and everything related to Tokenizers  Parsers  ASTs  etc.  We should explore if there's a way to get JavaCC to use actual interfaces for things.  It seems to be generating duplicate one-off implementations  but does not implement a standard set of interfaces.  Once we have 3+ JavaCC implementations in PMD  we really need a way to make them appear identical to all the PMD internals.  Settling on JavaCC as THE standard for PMD seems like the easiest choice for now  we can mix things up in the future once we get it working for the simplest case.  git-svn-id: https://pmd.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pmd/trunk@5931 51baf565-9d33-0410-a72c-fc3788e3496d,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

o Did some refactoring: moving utility methods to EclipseUtils so there's no   confusion as to which project is used.  o Use executedProject everywhere except for acquiring the artifact list; the    executedProject misses that list (that's because no deps are resolved in   the forked lifecycle execution; it's delayed until the plugin is encountered   and it's requiresDependencyResolution is seen.)  o Added flag -Declipse.downloadSources=true|false to skip source downloading   git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/components/trunk/maven-plugins@289188 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

[JUnit] Check assertion message present in assertEquals with delta  A missing assertion message for assertEquals(double  double  double) is detected in most cases now. If the assertEquals method has two arguments  an assertion message is missing  if the assertEquals method has three arguments  the first one has to be a string.  Pmd will only print an error if the first argument type has been determined (getType() != null) and isn't a String. Therefore assertEquals(getInt()  getInt()  getInt()) won't be detected as an error. However  double d = 1.0; assertEquals(d  1.0  1.0); will be detected.  The JUnitAssertionsShouldIncludeMessageRule.check method has been moved to the inner class AssertionCall and has been expanded by an isException hook. The assertEquals with three arguments check overrides the isException method  returns true if the first argument can't be determined or is a String and if so  no violation will be added. Also the constructor arguments have been swapped for readability.  https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1313/,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Attached is a patch to fix the current issues with building under jdbc1.   This patch moves the logic that looks up TypeOid  PGTypeName  and SQLTypeName from Field to Connection.  It is moved to connection since it needs to differ from the jdbc1 to jdbc2 versions and Connection already has different subclasses for the two driver versions.  It also made sense to move the logic to Connection as some of the logic was already there anyway.

Adding DomainRoot causes split in core  plus additional refactorings.  In this commit many files got moved around.  See below for details on some decisions and features already ported to the new version of the framework.  * Abstract support for BackEnd.  Each back end must implement the   `pt.ist.fenixframework.core.BackEnd` interface (and  typically  to provide a   subclass of `Config` that supports setting it up appropriately).  Closes #8.  * Closes #10: It was a design decision that the `DomainRoot` (DR) should be a   part of the `fenix-framework-core` (core).  Given that the DR must be   modelled in DML  then the core must run the DML compiler.  Thus  the DML   compiler must be moved out of the core (because of how maven dependencies   work).  This is accomplished in a new module `fenix-framework-dml-compiler`   (dml-compiler).  This module also gets the `DomainObject` (DO)  the   `AbstractDomainObject` (ADO)  and the default `PojoCodeGenerator` (PCJ).   Any code generator should generate domain classes that inherit (directly or   not) from ADO.  Any concretization of a domain model requires the   implementation of the `getExternalId()` and `getOid()` methods (from DO and   ADO  respectively).  * Now the core depends on the `dml-maven-plugin`  which implies that code used   by the plugin must be moved out of the core  namely the `Project` and   `DmlFile` classes.  This led to the creation of the   `fenix-framework-project` module  on which the `dml-maven-plugin` now   depends  besides depending on the dml-compiler  of course.  Additionally    because the core also contains the `@Atomic` annotation  this was also   extracted and moved to the dml-compiler.  Actually  it makes sense for the   DML compiler to be able to post-process domain classes (inject special   constructor and process `@Atomic` annotations).  * Closes #4.  The persistent-root module was later renamed to domain-root  and   even later it was decided to include the DR in the core.  The well-known ID   of the root object is hardcoded and hidden in each back end through the   implementation of `getDomainRoot()`.  * The core provides a default configuration with a default in-memory-only back   end.  Thus  it must provide a concrete implementation of `getExternalId()`   and `getOid()` for the DOs.  It uses a `CoreCoreGenerator` (CCG) that simply   extends the PCJ to set the domain class root to be the   `pt.ist.fenixframework.core.CoreDomainObject` class.  Because the CCG is   used by the dml-maven-plugin  which in turn runs before the main compilation   phase  the CCG must be made available in another module.  This is done in   `fenix-framework-core-code-generator`.  * Regarding issue #13: The ANT task is now on dml-compiler  but still needs to   be moved out of there to a separate module.  * Closes #7.  The transactional interface is not finished  but when the need   for more changes arises  a new issue should be created.  Moreover    @jcarvalho is looking into this in issue #15.  * Summary of dependencies between fenix-framework modules:    1. fenix-framework-dml-compiler: none.    2. fenix-framework-project: none.    3. dml-maven-plugin: 1  2.    4. fenix-framework-core-code-generator: 1.    5. fenix-framework-core: 1  2 (not yet  but will be added later)  3  4 (via   the plugin).,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Main change: Custom parser for expressions - created package ch.njol.lang and moved some relevant files into it - renamed Variable to SimpleVariable and Literal to SimpleLiteral   and created the interfaces Variable and Literal instead. - created a class ExprParser which is responsible for parsing expressions of all sort  Other changes: - Expressions can now only accept single variables  i.e. variables which will only ever return one value at most  and improved/added getters. - Events now init with literals instead of data arrays - Improved/fixed expression to string with 4 different cases (debug with/without event  the expression itself  and the value of the expression) - Improved error handling: errors are now buffered in 'sessions' before they are printed to console or a command sender. This still needs some work though. - Other small fixes/improvements I don't remember,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Clean up queueing so that the majority of queued events are strings.  This allows putting them in a persistent queue store.  The default 'enqueue' is string-only now.  Classes that want object-enqueueing can cast to PlainMessageQueue and call enqueueObject.  Syntactic vinegar.  Make many relatively simple value objects that get passed around in queues implement the bean specification  so they can be passed around as XML instead.  (This is done with 'enqueueBean'  a terrible name  but dequeued objects are automatically unmarshalled back into the correct objects.)  Everything that passed around an AuctionEntry object to a queue now just passes the identifier  and the queue processor gets the entry from EntryCorral.  There may be a better way to do this  but for now  this works.  The TimeQueueManager does unpleasant things to manage the differences between different kinds of payloads that need to be delivered.  Possibly wrong things  also.  Canceling and setting snipes go directly to the server  instead of being queued  since it's not a long-running operation.  (Lowering the number of moving parts in sniping operations.)  Thumbnail lookup and handling just involves a String URL  which is turned into real URL in the manager.  This allows the thumbnail manager to be the only one that actually downloads the images  instead of the ebayAuction object.  The code to clear out multiple TIMECHECK operations is removed.  There is a custom Searcher serialize/deserialize method that calls on SearchManager.getSearchById() to only load the right item.  Theoretically I could do this for enqueuing AuctionEntry objects (on deserialize  pull them from EntryCorral) also  but...not right now.   I hate making huge checkins like this  but once I started making deep changes to the queueing infrastructure  I couldn't check it in until it was all at least stable and working.   git-svn-id: svn://svn.jbidwatcher.com/jbidwatcher/trunk@893 b1acfa68-eb39-11db-b167-a3a8cd6b847e,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Change the """"excludeMarker"""" to """"suppressMarker"""" to make this consistent with the use of """"suppress"""" elsewhere in PMD  and with the standard Java @SuppressWarnings() annotation.  Remove some of the processFiles() APIs on the PMD class  we really don't need that many of them.  In this regard  the one API that allowed a LanguageVersion to be passed explicitly has been removed  and the RuleContext class update to indicate this is the preferred method of indicating the LanguageVersion to use when processing a source file.  Initial cut at adding a Configuration class  for storing all PMD configuration related items.  So far  I've just moved the stuff that was stored on the PMD class itself to the Configuration class.  Additional work will be done to move the stuff currently in CommandLineOptions and in the Ant task onto the Configuration class.  Then the processFiles methods will be modified to take a Configuration option.  This should prevent the proliferation of processFile() methods in the future  and make it possible to unify some common aspects of the command line/Ant usages.  git-svn-id: https://pmd.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pmd/trunk@6208 51baf565-9d33-0410-a72c-fc3788e3496d ",move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Add Column  Field  and Fields classes  Add seven new classes:  - Field.java - an abstract class that defines a """"field""""  i.e.    a piece of data that we may display in the table  once per row - TextField.java  ImageField.java  ComboField.java  CheckboxField.java:   subclasses of Field.java  which are intended to hold specific types of   data  with specialized methods for those types - Fields.java - defines the fields of the program as public static   instances of Field - Column.java - a Column is what is used to display a Field.  Our Column   class encapsulates TableColumn  the actual UI class that is part of the   table.  We are able to keep some other helpful data in the Column   class  too.  A Column must be associated with a Field.  It's required in the constructor  and is final.  A Field can either have a null column (indicating it is not currently displayed in the Table)  or can have one Column  which must refer back to the Field.  It is an error to try to assign a Column to a Field that already has a Column  or to try to assign a Column to a Field where that Column already refers to a different Field.  In addition to the seven new classes  we make major changes to ResultsTable.java:  - The fields had previously been defined as integer constants  whose   values corresponded to the column IDs.  The column IDs are created by   the Table  when the columns are added to it.  So  the definitions   required """"knowing"""" the order in which the code added them.  Now we   import the Fields from Fields.java. - All the cell get/set methods from ResultsTable now become methods on   the Field.  ResultsTable no longer deals with Images; that's too level.   It just deals with the ItemState  and the ImageField turns that into an   actual Image. - Methods used for sorting  itemDestDisplayedText and getItemTextValue    previously were static methods defined in ResultsTable  which had to do   some checking/dispatching depending on the type of the field.  Now the   functionality lives in the Field classes  and is specific to the   subclass of Field that is being used. - The sortTable method no longer takes a TableColumn and a column ID;   those two pieces of data are now encapsulated within the new Column   class  which is what we pass  instead. - Move the column creation call into the Field.  We create the column by   asking the Field to do it.  In turn  it calls into Column  which can   also define the selection behavior (sort by """"this"""" column) - Therefore  we no longer need the sortTable wrapper method; the code   that creates the Column knows how to figure out the sortDirection. - We also add getTableColumn() to Field  and use it instead of   Table.getColumn().  Field.getTableColumn() could return null  under the   idea that we may define Fields that the user chooses not to display in   the Table.  That is currently not supported  but it's something I   intend to add. ",move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Massive refactors. This list isn't complete  but should give you an idea:  A) many things in lombok.eclipse moved to lombok.core to enable reuse with lombok.javac.  B) lombok.javac works now similarly to eclipse's model: We first make big ASTs that are bidirectionally traversable  then we walk through that for annotations.  C) Instead of getting an annotation instance  you now get an object that is more flexible and can e.g. give you class values in an enum as a string instead of a Class object  which may fail if that class isn't on the classpath of lombok.  D) sources to the internal sun classes for javac added to /contrib.,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hopefully the last of the big exceptions refactorings. I went through all of the places we're adding context to our Errors object and made sure we're never doubling-up -- specifing the same injection point or key multiple times.  The new errors have nice 'at' lines for parameters  fields and linked bindings. Hopefully this makes it easier to follow the stacktraces. Additional context (such as the binding's origin in a module) could be added later if desired. Currently we have module-specific sources in CreationExceptions  and plain old binding sources elsewhere. The end result is messages that can look like this:  com.google.inject.ProvisionException: Guice provision errors:  1) Error injecting constructor  java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException   at com.google.inject.ProvisionExceptionTest$RealD.<init>(ProvisionExceptionTest.java:284)   at binding for com.google.inject.ProvisionExceptionTest$RealD.class(ProvisionExceptionTest.java:284)   at binding for com.google.inject.ProvisionExceptionTest$D.class(ProvisionExceptionTest.java:1)  1 error  git-svn-id: https://google-guice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@652 d779f126-a31b-0410-b53b-1d3aecad763e,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Bugfix: JENKINS-10638 Enhancement: JENKINS-10637 Bugfix: JENKINS-10719  including  - New feature: Ignore parent stream - can now tell a project to ignore changes made in the basis stream of the actual stream being built.  This can signficantly reduce the time the plugin takes talking to the accurev server.  - New feature: Get streams singly - more of an accurev client workaround really; the plugin used to call the server and get """"the streams"""" which included absolutely everything under the sun  and this turns into many megabytes of data  every poll and every build.  This server setting says to get just the streams we care about (our stream  our parent stream etc)  albeit at the cost of potentially making more than one call to the server. Enhancement: Logging improved  which should make debugging accurev client failures a little easier. Enhancement: Now weakly caches the XmlPullParserFactory. Refactor: Extracted out code that runs the accurev client command into its own class  reducing duplicated code and making parsing of command-output more consistent. Refactor: Split out many of AccurevSCM's inner classes into their own files in an attempt to make the main class more maintainable.

"Application ----------- * entirely reworked the """"Sequence / Image operation"""" band :   - new sequence resize feature.   - new C/Z/T operations.   - new color conversion feature.   - general improvements. * better plugin error report. * better colormap preservation when switching from 2D to 3D canvas. * better Icy to ImageJ ROI conversion. * minors improvements here and there. * modified ROI2DPoint so it now intersects point and do not contains it (more consistent with other ROI). * fixed a minor bug in ROI.getBooleanMask() method. * fixed a minor bug in ROI2D.contains() and ROI2D.intersects() methods. * others bugs fixes.   Developer --------- * Loader :   - added methods to hide the progress bar.   - added 'getMetaData(File file)' method to retrieve the metadata of an image file.   - added 'loadImage(File file  int z  int t)' method to load a single image from multi image file. * added IcyBufferedImage.copyData(src  int srcChannel  int dstChannel) to only copy data for a specified channel. * added ExcelTable component to display excel type table. * added abstract method 'getViewComponent()' to IcyCanvas so we can always retrieve the display component in a Canvas. * improvements on 'SequencePreviewPanel' and 'SequenceRangePreviewPanel' components. * added IcyBufferedImageUtil class (general IcyBufferedImage tools). * added methods to SequenceUtil class. * fixed cursor preservation on Canvas2D. * added MainInterface.getSequences(String name) to retrieve sequence by name. * fixed a bug in ImageDataIterator. * added a command line option to remove splash-screen. * lot of refactoring and source reorganisation (check deprecations).",move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Refactor calculated subjects to be more useful  Added a SubjectDataReference to handle some of the logic of a reference to a changing immutable subject data object  and updated code to use this. Transient and persistent data references are now also exposed through the calculated subject.  The calculated subject also provides debug output for high-level queries made to it. Implementations that customize permissions lookup in some way (I'm looking at you  Spigot) still need to do their own lookup. Unfortunately  there's no way to get a subject's name (rather than identifier)  so players will only be shown by UUID in debug output.,move,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0.05,0.034615385,0.021978022,0.037383178,0,0.038709677,0,0.058823529,0,0,0.025974026,0.034722222,0.013245033,0.049382716,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.4,0,0,0,0,0.040816327,0.045977011,0.03960396,0.035714286

Use UIStarter constructor instead of init()We were just using a default (not explicitly defined) constructor for UIStarter but then immediately after it was created Launcher would call run() which would call init(). Instead make what was previously init() be a constructor.By doing this we can make the three instance variables in UIStarter be final because they are now initialized in the constructor.Then the run() method has nothing left to do except call launch().

Provide a better support of the Revision Labels and a details history between them.This is a squashed merge of a refactoring done for respecting the attached files added by the user.At the same time numerous speed improvement was done to enable a faster importation by doing less interaction with the Starteam Server. If built from the Fake Starteam speed is increased by a lot. It should be on par if you did build against the StarteamSDK.* Provide a means to get the file from history by view version* Create a fake revision labelAdded revision labels to the mix of required changes.* Create test data for testing revision labels import* Get rid of meaning less todo* Extract the creation of a commit entry from the recursive file populationThis way we can get a detailed history of the individual files to extract andrecreated a much better history* Properly create the file based on the view versionPotential issue where the viewVersion !  contentVersion.* Create a commit strategy to experiment alternative to file populationThe current limitation of readability of the code for creating commits inGitImporter class is at its limits. The FilePopulationStrategy aim toextract the history creation of the view since the last configuration. Thiswill permits some simplification on the configuration of GitImporter classand provide a wider range of technique to extract the history from aStarteam view.* Implement the getViewVersion() for potential future use* Provide a version of a file based on a label id* Properly return null if the item is not attach to the label* Move deletion composition and rename finding into BasePopulationStrategy* Moved the Rename the FilePopulationStrategy* Retab some old modified functions* Remove some dead code* Add verbosity to the base strategy* Properly build the path and fix other bug found making the tests* Re enable cleanup of repository after an execution of import* Add a test for the base file populationThis is to make sure that there isn t any regression added for the creationof the list of commits.* Make sure the shareTo is executed before the update.* Make sure we don t ever get cached objects* Added a means of querying the last files the strategy has seen* Clarify the condition and reformat for understandability* Optimize the overuse of pathname and improve testing of isChild.* Increase test to be closer to real potential use.* Rename class to have a better logic to it.* Added the base integration of the commit strategy* Cache the toString() return value for increased performance* Finalize rename of classes and use ContentVersion instead of ViewVersion* Correct the misleading property names.StarteamSDK documentation isn t consistent with itself which lead to thesekind of errors.* Added Revision Strategy which is only a Base strategy for now* Correct a bad assumption regarding history orderThe history shall be from the newest version to the oldest* Inform the commit strategy about the current labelAnd at the same time get check if we need to make a tag associated with thislabel.* Properly initialize the strategy for Change Request.* Correct the move operation and name the commit accordingly* Use the commit strategy in the git importerAnd fix the test regarding the new behavior.* Correct a move operation badly detected* correct problem where openjdk !  oraclejdk* Use char sequence instead of string directly* Replace the join with a more primitive version.* Prevent back and forth for information we already knowAnd at the same time remove some dead code.* Do not enforce the missing build.date tokenFallback to the label revision time instead. If user only want a set ofbuild label he will need to apply a proper filter to not select someoperationnal label.* Provide a better explanaison of the reason we are selecting those fields.* Extract the method which process a single file.This is to actually override it label in the RevisionPopulationStrategy.Some other strategy may be better to select all the files but the simplestfor now is to simply iterate recursively through all files and only selectthose that are attached to the requested labels.* Correct bad logic regarding deleted files.* Added basic test for revision labels strategy* Promote debug logs to verbose* Implement support from specific revision label support* Create the view with the right time.* Move set of the earliest time from GitImporter to the Base Strategy* Simplify more the ChangeRequest commit filter* Correct the computation of the time of the commit correction* Add some more test for the implementation of the Revision labels* Implement the revision labels management and importation* Comment log relating a label with only some files* Implement a label exclusion to rule out some misleading revisions.* use proper javadoc syntax* add missing header in new files.* Cache all change request prior to starting the import* Put the initial version in its own variable.Such modification will enable to retreive all the files version from thestarteam repository but with a good chance of weird effect. It is betterto keep 1 for now as the renames or move operations won t be correctlyreflected.* Make sure to only poke getViewVersion onceIt does seem to make a round trip to the server which slow down theconversion process.* Add somekind of progress bar* Provide a retry mechanism for fetching items versions.If somebody does a commit at the same time we do make fetching of the versionsof a files we may end up crashing. We try to protect from this crash asfrom the server.* Add missing import* Add more resiliance when no change request availables* Correct comment and casing of the members* Disconnect once we are finished with the import* Make less interaction with the Starteam Server,inline,0,0,0,0,0.0625,0,0.066666667,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012048193,0,0.011904762,,0,0,0,0.019607843,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.142857143,0.142857143,0.142857143,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

drop the ConfigRoot interface.This was intended to make resolve() typesafe (only allowed on root objects).However in practice it was not safe because it was too easy to create aroot by merging a non root object into a root object.

Various fixes and simplifications to is{ Not}InstanceOf mostly under GWT: Make assertThat(...).is{ Not}InstanceOf(SomeInterface.class) blow up with a helpful message under GWT rather than always fail in the case of isInstanceOf and always succeed in the case of isNotInstanceOf. Make assertThat(null).isInstanceOf(...) fail() under GWT instead of throw NPE. (That said see b/34135320. But for now let s bring our GWT behavior in line with our JVM behavior.) This also simplifies the code a bit. Delete PlatformTest which tests the helper methods directly in favor of adding more tests to SubjectTest including tests for the cases above. Remove isInstanceOfTypeGWT from the JRE copy of Platform. It s used only from tests not from the actual Truth implementation. Also its tests don t run on GWT. (We could make them run on GWT but that doesn t help much since again that code isn t used from the actual Truth implementation.) Simplify the actual GWT implementation to avoid calling getName() and to avoid constructing a Set. (Also simplify the JRE implementation by inlining the helper method.) Leave a TODO to test with class metadata off which will demonstrate additional problems that show up only under that setting.Relevant: https://github.com/google/truth/issues/198Relnotes:Made `assertThat(...).is{ Not}InstanceOf(SomeInterface.class)` blow up with a helpful message under GWT rather than always fail in the case of `isInstanceOf` and always succeed in the case of `isNotInstanceOf`.Made `assertThat(null).isInstanceOf(...)` `fail()` under GWT instead of throw `NullPointerException`.

drop the ConfigRoot interface.This was intended to make resolve() typesafe (only allowed on root objects).However in practice it was not safe because it was too easy to create aroot by merging a non root object into a root object.

Combine two methods into getReplacementText.Previously FileEpisode had getNewFilename which would construct a new filename out of downloaded information if in fact that information was successfully obtained. The method would return various other pieces of text in the case where we didn t yet have sufficient information.Then we had getNewFilePath which took the result of getNewFilename and if move was enabled prepended the destination directory.getNewFilename was useful as a public function in two places:(1) when we first create the table item we assume we won t yet have have the file information so we called getNewFilename to get the placeholder text and then registered a listener to change it when we had the information(2) in the FileEpisodeTest we want to validate the name without the destination directory getting in the way(1) is solved by simply having the placeholder texts be returned by the combined method. (2) was already solved by always disabling move for those tests the returned text will never have the directory prepended.As far as a name goes neither getNewFilename nor getNewFilePath were really accurate since it could very well return a different type of text so I m settling on getReplacementText .

Remove the need for explicit row locks when allocating UIDs.  The existing code with explicit row locks exhibited very poor performance  and also prevented multiple TSDs from allocating UIDs concurrently.  The new approach consists in:   1. Performing an atomic increment to grab a new UID.   2. CAS ing (CompareAndSet) the reverse mapping (uid  > name)   3. CAS ing the forward mapping (name  > uid)  If we die after step 1  we waste an UID.  If we die after step 2  we just end up with an orphaned reverse mapping (harmless).  When two TSDs race to assign a UID to the same name  one of them will fail to CAS the forward mapping at step 3  and will retry to find the UID assigned by the winning TSD.  When that occurs  the only net consequence is that a UID will have been wasted by the losing TSD  whereas the previous implementation wouldn t waste one when this happened.  The  uid fsck  command can easily detect orphaned or wasted UIDs  and we could conceivably put them on some kind of a free list in the future to re allocate them.  If two TSDs are running side by side  and one uses the old method while the other uses the new lock less method  things still work as expected.  There are two possible scenarios:     Old TSD goes first  locks the MAXID row  and does its thing.     The new TSD will have to wait until the row lock is released     for its atomic increment to go through.     The new TSD goes first  atomically increments the MAXID row      and does its thing.  The second TSD locks the MAXID row and     proceeds to allocate its own ID concurrently.,inline,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.001675042,0,0.003322259,0.007751938,0,0,0,0,0,0.006535948,0.004807692,0.011235955,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.000588235,0,0,0,0

Various fixes and simplifications to is{ Not}InstanceOf  mostly under GWT:    Make assertThat(...).is{ Not}InstanceOf(SomeInterface.class) blow up with a helpful message under GWT  rather than always fail in the case of isInstanceOf and always succeed in the case of isNotInstanceOf.    Make assertThat(null).isInstanceOf(...) fail() under GWT instead of throw NPE. (That said  see b/34135320. But for now  let s bring our GWT behavior in line with our JVM behavior.) This also simplifies the code a bit.    Delete PlatformTest  which tests the helper methods directly  in favor of adding more tests to SubjectTest  including tests for the cases above.    Remove isInstanceOfTypeGWT from the JRE copy of Platform. It s used only from tests  not from the actual Truth implementation. Also its tests don t run on GWT. (We could make them run on GWT  but that doesn t help much  since again  that code isn t used from the actual Truth implementation.)    Simplify the actual GWT implementation to avoid calling getName() and to avoid constructing a Set. (Also  simplify the JRE implementation by inlining the helper method.)    Leave a TODO to test with class metadata off  which will demonstrate additional problems that show up only under that setting.  Relevant: https://github.com/google/truth/issues/198  Relnotes:   Made `assertThat(...).is{ Not}InstanceOf(SomeInterface.class)` blow up with a helpful message under GWT  rather than always fail in the case of `isInstanceOf` and always succeed in the case of `isNotInstanceOf`.   Made `assertThat(null).isInstanceOf(...)` `fail()` under GWT instead of throw `NullPointerException`.

In such a case  the pipe will never get connected  and so the write fills up the local temporary buffer.  In this change  I m getting rid of the local temporary buffer altogether. I suppose this can increase the latency of this specific pipe operation  but the other fix is to have a bounded buffer size  and the added complexity doesn t seem to be worth it.

Hopefully the last of the big exceptions refactorings. I went through all of the places we re adding context to our Errors object and made sure we re never doubling up    specifing the same injection point or key multiple times.  The new errors have nice  at  lines for parameters  fields and linked bindings. Hopefully this makes it easier to follow the stacktraces. Additional context (such as the binding s origin in a module) could be added later if desired. Currently we have module specific sources in CreationExceptions  and plain old binding sources elsewhere. The end result is messages that can look like this:  com.google.inject.ProvisionException: Guice provision errors:  1) Error injecting constructor  java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException   at com.google.inject.ProvisionExceptionTest$RealD.<init>(ProvisionExceptionTest.java:284)   at binding for com.google.inject.ProvisionExceptionTest$RealD.class(ProvisionExceptionTest.java:284)   at binding for com.google.inject.ProvisionExceptionTest$D.class(ProvisionExceptionTest.java:1)  1 error  git svn id: https://google guice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@652 d779f126 a31b 0410 b53b 1d3aecad763e,inline,0,0,0,0,0.058823529,0,0.071428571,0,0,0.15,0.333333333,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2,0.333333333,0.2,0.230769231,0,0,0.5,0.171428571,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Rewrite substitution resolver  use explicit immutable ResolveSource  The immediate motivation here was to fix  177  which this does  but in this commit a couple of existing test cases are broken in a way which seems to relate to order of resolution and resolve memoization. So we need to layer on to this commit better solutions for caching and cycle detection to get rid of yet more mutable state.  The previous setup used a side effect based lookup table of """"replacement"""" values to conceptually modify the tree without actually modifying it. Unfortunately that setup was hacky and hard to reason about and  apparently  broken in cases such as  177.  This new setup actually creates a modified tree and passes it around explicitly instead of inside ResolveContext.  In this commit  ResolveContext still unfortunately has a mutable cache and a mutable table of """"cycle markers."""" Both of those in theory could also be replaced by simply modifying the tree.  The main downside to this commit   and to cleaning up the remaining mutable state   is that we re using Java collections which have to be copied wholesale for every mutation (they are not persistent functional data structures). This will have an unknown performance impact  though in a sane world Config.resolve() is not a bottleneck in anyone s production app.  Some other details of this commit:   * resolve concerns removed from peekPath in AbstractConfigObject    and relocated into ResolveSource  * recursive resolution removed from lookupSubst and moved to    ConfigReference  * new hasDescendant() method used only in debug tracing     it is grossly inefficient to ever call this full tree    traversal  * new replaceChild() method is inefficient due to Java    collections but could in theory be made efficient  * most complexity relates to always knowing the parent of    a node that we might have to replace  so we can walk    up replacing it in its ancestor chain  TODO in subsequent commits:   * fix failing test cases  * we cannot replaceChild if we are a descendant of ConfigConcatenation     but we probably (?) need to be able to; consider / fix this  * instead of memoizing resolve results in a hash table  just    continuously modify the ResolveSource to have the most recent    results  * instead of using the """"cycle markers"""" table  change the    ConfigReference to a cycle detector value ",inline,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.005025126,0.012987013,0.006644518,0,0.010582011,0,0,0,0,0.013071895,0.009615385,0,0.014184397,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

JCBC 906: Index Management experimental API second iteration  Motivation:             After the first experimental API implementation in JCBC 777  an SDK RFC was created and a few elements received feedback  hence this second iteration.  Modifications:                New specific exceptions have been added for case where index creation is attempted on already existing index  and where drop of an index that doesn t exist is attempted.  The watchIndex method has been removed in favor of just using the more generic watchIndexes with a single parameter.

Even more performance issues fixed. I do not guarantee there are no bugs in this build ;). Status of what else needs to be done will be assessed later on. What has changed:  1. If EVERY protection is inside of the cache  it is safe to assume that any block NOT in the cache  IS NOT in the database.    We leverage this fact heavily in this build to give a significant boost to performance. 2. Caches. Cache ALL the computations. Numerous caches have been added in various places where specific points of bad performance    was located at. These caches generally only store computationally expensive calls; overall this is also significant after the    caches are nice and toasty. 3. Modules   before  LWC s own module system would broadcast events to every registered module. This added a overhead of about    1k nanoseconds per module  if they didn t override the method. This has been changed to detect at runtime what methods    they have overrided and then ONLY send events to modules that have them overridden. We could have modules register what    events they use but this would break backwards compatibility with plugins that hook into LWC. This uses reflection but    is all done on startup so the overhead is minimal. The gains is fairly large and worthwhile.  There is still a potential to shave off even more precious cpu cycles but this will be assessed further once initial results are in.

"Node analyze() can now replace the current AST node. This is needed for cases where the parser does not know better and creates the wrong type of AST nodes. This submit looks much bigger than it is. Because almost every class implements Node  adding the replacement node as a return value of analyze() touched many classes  but the changes are minimal. In most cases  """"this"""" is returned  i.e. the Node is not replaced. The first and so far only example of actually replacing the node is a QualifiedIde that is mistaken for a DotExpr  since they cannot be distinguished syntactically. Only after parsing the imports  the compiler can detect that a DotExpr is indeed a QualifiedIde. Transforming the AST has to keep all symbols  including their white space. It then makes it easier to analyze other expressions  e.g. to detect non invoking access to static members of other classes  which have to be initialized before accessing the member. Warning: I was too lazy to always reassign child nodes with the result of Node analyze()  because I know that currently  only DotExprs may be replaced. This is a TODO  because it may lead to surprises in case the same technique is used for other nodes in the future.

Attached is a patch that does the following:  1) improves performance of commit/rollback by reducing number of round trips to the server 2) uses 7.1 functionality for setting the transaction isolation level 3) backs out a patch from 11 days ago because that code failed to compile under jdk1.1  Details:  1)  The old code was doing the following for each commit:    commit    begin    set transaction isolation level xxx thus a call to commit was performing three round trips to the database.   The new code does this in one round trip as:    commit; begin; set transaction isolation level xxx  In a simple test program that performs 1000 transactions (where each transaction does one simple select inside that transaction) has the following before and after timings:  Client and Server on same machine  old         new                 1.877sec    1.405sec   25.1% improvement  Client and Server on different machines old         new                 4.184sec    2.927sec   34.3% improvement  (all timings are an average of four different runs)   2)  The driver was using  set transaction isolation level xxx  at the begining of each transaction  instead of using the new 7.1 syntax of  set session characteristics as transaction isolation level xxx  which only needs to be done once instead of for each transaction.  This is done conditionally (i.e. if server is 7.0 or older do the old behaviour  else do the new behaviour) to not break backward compatibility.  This also required the movement of some code to check/test database version numbers from the DatabaseMetaData object to the Connection object.  3) Finally while testing  I discovered that the code that was checked in   11 days ago actually didn t compile.  The code in the patch for Connection.setCatalog() used Properties.setProperty() which only exists in JDK1.2 or higher.  Thus compiling the JDBC1 driver failed as this method doesn t exist.  Thus I backed out that patch.   Barry Lind,inline,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.028571429,0,0.028571429,,0,0,0,0.028571429,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"449495 : improve ProjectConfiguration sort order  introduced new runsAfter and runsBefore attributes to the configurator extension point.  runsAfter : Optional comma separated list of ids of required project configurators this configurator should run after. ids suffixed with ? are considered optional  runsBefore : Optional comma separated list of ids of optional project configurators this configurator should run before. ids suffixed with * are considered required  The secondaryTo attribute has been deprecated.  For any given mojoExecution  a Directed Acyclic Graph is built from the configurators list and their runsAfter/runsBefore configurator dependencies.  Configurators are sorted twice :    once per mojoexecution. Only configurators participating to that mojoexecution are considered     once for project configuration. All configurators from all mojoexecutions are sorted.  So if a project configurator pc1 needs to run after another configurator pc2 defined in a separate mojoexecution  it will need to declare : runsAfter """"pc2?""""  so the first mojoexecution sort doesn t fail.

"  Undid redesign of April 2011. Most importantly  instead of a subclass of java.io.File  OverthereFile is now an abstract base class. Subclassing only made the implementation more complex and added no benefits: any other code used expects to be able to open a FileInputStream or a FileOutputStream to a java.io.File  which won t work for remote files. This change also allows for more specific semantics of delete()  mkdir()  mkdirs()  and renameTo().   Removed API methods that have better alternatives  e.g. use listFiles instead of list.   Removed convenience methods such as get(OutputStream).   Renamed get() to getInputStream() and put(long) to getOutputStream(long).   Renamed HostConnection to OverthereConnection.   Renamed OverhereConnection.startExecute() to OverthereConnection.startProcess().   Renamed CommandExecution to OverthereProcess.   Renamed CommandExecutionCallbackHandler to OverthereProcessOutputHandler.   Improved OverthereProcessOutputHandler implementations: they can now be created using static methods and can be grouped with the MultipleOverthereProcessOutputHandler.   Improved performance of SSH (and specifically SCP) protocol by reducing wait time in loop waiting for completion of a command from 1000ms to 50ms.   Fixed bug in SshInteractiveSudoOverthereConnection where it could not handle a password prompt that does not end in """"assword:"""" but has """"assword"""" somewhere in the middle.   Added CmdLine/CmdLineArgument abstraction of command line to allow for better hiding of passwords in logs and implement command line encoding (moved here from from OperatingSystemFamily).   Improved Over   Reimplemented OverthereConnection.execute() in terms of OverthereConnection.startProcess(): reduces duplicate code in protocol implementations  ensures execute() and startProcess() have identical semantics  and forces all protocol implementations to implement startProcess() so that the WSADMIN and WLST daemons will always work.   Set source and target compatibility to 1.6.   Added building of sources (and javadoc once artifacts.gradle is fixed).   Added dependency on Guava. Should replace all use of Apache Commons soon.   Using Scannit for annotation scanning instead of Reflections.   Updated notes in README.md.

Improvement to candidate session launch workflow  I have moved the candidate session entry to a separate step after the session is first instantiated.

"Previously migrations would migrate a sequence of models to their latest versions in order.  However  if you are crossing a series of versions  it s possible your migrations actually have intra model version dependencies.  For instance  if App.eomodeld depends on Authentication.eomodeld  you can t just blindly migrate Authentication to the latest version followed by migrating App to the latest version.  It s possible you may have to: Auth >3  App >1  Auth >4  App >2.  This change introduces the ability for a migration to return a version dependency for another model.  Previously  dependent models were not automatically migrated  either.  This can potentially cause strange problems.  Not dependencies are traversed so that by the end of the migration process for Model """"A""""  """"A"""" and all of its reachable dependent models will be upgraded to their latest versions.  If you are migrating to a SPECIFIC version  then dependent models can not automatically be upgraded to any version other than what your migrations specify in their dependencies.

XLS export now always export all ROIs.    some minors issues fixed. * ROIPanel: fixed some issues in refreshing data or actions. * Rectangle3D/4D/5D: severals fixes with infinite dimension. * FileUtil: added toFiles(..) and toPaths(..) File <  > String conversion methods. * several improvements in the Exception/Error catcher and report. plugin causing the exception). * Anchor2D: added Anchor2DPositionListener to replace the old deprecated Anchor2DListener * added support for local plugin repositories. * others fixes  cleanup and refactoring.

"Enhancements to how queries with bind values are stored internally and sent to the server.  Previously we allocated a new String object for the entire final query we were sending to the database.  If you had a big query  or especially if you had large bind values you ended up with essentially two copies in memory. This change will reuse the existing objects and therefore should take 1/2 the memory it does today for a given query.  This restructuring will also allow in the future the ability to stream bytea data to the server instead of the current approach of pulling it all into memory. I also fixed a test that was failing on a 7.2 database. Also renamed some internal variables and some minor cleanup.

This ensures consistent use of this configuration and data structures by all maven calls performed by the thread.

Introduce call  call adapters  and the response type.  * `Call` is the mechanism for request execution. It encapsulates a single request action either synchronously or asynchronously  and can support canceling. * `CallAdapter` is a means of supporting a method return type other than `Call` (like RxJava s `Observable`) by adapting the `Call` instance into another instance. This change moves RxJava support into a sibling module which uses an adapter for supporting `Observable` types. * `Response` represents the HTTP response along side the deserialized body.

"Purge references to block ids from most of the code  Block ids are going away in Minecraft. Each block should be referenced by its name.  Why?       Block ids will of course still be used internally in the save files and network packets  but to the outside world they re gone. In the future  Minecraft will use dynamic ids everywhere. Grass doens t have to be id 2  it could as well be id 23. At the moment all vanilla blocks still have a static id.  Mods  on the other hand  already use dynamic ids  Forge takes care of that. When registering a block in Forge  it is unknown to the modder which id the block will get.  Up until this commit  Terrain Control still used block ids everywhere in the code. This maked it a hassle for users of Terrain Control to find out what the id was of a modded block. From now on  modded blocks can just be referenced by their name.  Breakdown            Most instances of """"int id  int data"""" have been replaced by """"LocalMaterialData material"""". LocalMaterialData holds both the block and its data. LocalMaterialData is immutable  so it can be easily shared to other classes. LocalMaterialData has two methods to create a new instance with different block data: withBlockData(data) to change the block data to something else  and rotate() to automatically rotate the block data. rotate() uses the BlockHelper class to achieve this. As the """"Local"""" in the name suggests  LocalMaterialData is implemented by the Bukkit and Forge versions of Terrain Control. You can use TerrainControl.readMaterial(String) or TerrainControl.toLocalMaterialData(DefaultMaterial int blockData).  A new class called MaterialSet has been added. This class replaces the various block list implementations we have seen so far in Terrain Control. All block lists now have consistent behaviour. You can now for example use """"Solid"""" or """"All"""" in the SourceBlocks in the resources of the BiomeConfigs and in the BlockChecks in BO3s. Previously this was only possible in spawnOnBlockType in BO2s. MaterialSet will get a few improvements soon to let it work better with block data.  Some places in the code still use the byte[] id arrays. I m not sure at the moment what should happen with them. However  the ids in those arrays are dynamic now.  Old configs              Ids in old configs will still be read. DefaultMaterial.getMaterial(int id) continues to provide a block id lookup for the vanilla blocks. Even when all ids become dynamic in Minecraft  DefaultMaterial will still use the old static ids to make sure that old worlds still load properly.

UserRequest now contains multiple respond() abstractions that all end up calling a single respond() function that refreshes the user s authentication token cookie and then calls the parent s respond().

The varargs log methods (as well as checkGLError messages) are now overloaded with non varargs methods  so runtime intensive code (like the setUniform methods in CoreShader) that doesn t need to use the argument processing can log messages directly instead. This *significantly* reduces varargs pollution by eliminating needless creation of empty Object[] objects by the JVM when making simple checkGLError or other log calls to CoreGL/CoreLogger.  Update CoreGL + implementations to support overloaded checkGLError methods with no varargs.

Major refactoring.  The jdbc package was in pretty bad shape and was extremely hard to modify.  Some of the changes made to fix this were:   o Refactored the JdbcMigrationContext so that the source of connections is    abstracted.  A BasicDataSource that wraps a connection has been added to    support environments without access to a data source.  o All database specific configuration options are now set on the    JdbcMigrationContext.  The patch path is set on the migration launcher.  o Fixed the way that database connections were being closed.  The old way    caused pooled datasources to hang.  o Less connection passing: every class can obtain its connection from the context  o Put the concept formerly known as dialect into it s own class: DatabaseType  o Added support for Oracle.  This turned out to be a pain since the Oracle JDBC    driver doesn t support multiple statements in a single Statement.execute call like    Postgres does.  o Renaming: many of the old names didn t make sense.  I tried to make the changes as backwards compatible as possible  but I haven t tested this with an existing application.  You have been warned.  This whole thing needs to be repackaged under net.sf.autopatch at some point.,inline,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Commiting the code of v1.3    New Features: Custom commands now use my parser Added entity data (e.g. one can now use angry wolves  powered creepers  different villagers  etc.) Added a /skript reload command to reload the main config and all scripts Added expressions  last spawned entity  and  line   of <block>   whereas the latter can currently only be read and cleared  but not set    Changes:  Trigger files  are now called  scripts   end in  .sk  and are located in the  scripts/  folder The main config also now ends in  .sk  Variables are now stored in a csv file Merged right and leftclick into one event such that one can now use  on click on ...   The entity/player/etc.  cannot be used in damage events anymore  one has to use  attacker  or  victim  respectively Several changes in the API  e.g. removed LoopExpr   all expressions can now be looped Block loops now loop from bottom to top and not from left to right (whatever  left  or  right  is)  Argument    can now also be accessed as  argument <type>  or  <type> argument   e.g.  arg player  or  player argument   Targeted block  is now stored during an event  resulting in faster execution and no unexpected results when changing any blocks in the player s LOS.

"Major internal changes to XMLOutputter  and some public and protected method signature changes.  The code is now much cleaner with regard to whitespace handling  and the """"text trim"""" printing behaves a whole lot better.  In fact  the following settings now pretty print on output even if the doc contains some content with whitespace from a file and some content built in memory with no whitespace!  setTrimText(true); setIndent(""""  """"); setNewlines(true);  It may not perfectly match everyone s idea of """"pretty"""" but in my mind it s """"pretty"""" good.  : )  BTW  the default settings (no trim  no indent  no newlines) still behave the exact same as before and print the document raw.  Among the structural changes: The printXXX() methods now only print XXX and don t concern themselves with whitespace around the XXX item. For example  printComment() prints only the comment from <!   to   > and doesn t try to print the new lines and indention before and after. The only place where whitespace handling occurs is printDocument() for document level whitespace and printElementContent() for the whitespace between an element s tags.  But in both these cases the whitespace is naturally within the item being printed.  The signature changes:  * Deprecated """"public setIndentLevel()"""" method.  Having a global indent is   better done with a stacked FilterOutputStream.  The method is now empty.   It ll be removed after beta7. * Deprected """"public setPadText()"""" method.  It s not needed with the   current output mechanism.  The method is now empty.  It ll be removed   after beta7. * Changed the """"protected printXXX()"""" methods to have a new signature   without the """"int indentLevel"""" final parameter.  Didn t bother with   deprecation here.

Rework type resolution     JavaTypeDefinition now lazily resolves generics  meaning less overhead and avoiding access order problems (ie: class Foo extends <A extends B  B>).

This makes things a little clearer and tidier    There are some minor API changes  but since 5.8.0 is recently out I doubt these have any impact.

Fix  773   Add global_annotations to graphs  Fixed a bug in which global_annotations were ignored by GraphHandler.java (and thus  were not rendered by gnuplot).

Note: Since both GraphHandler.java and QueryRpc.java implement (similar) query processing logic  all of this should be unified in the future (requires a large refactor to split all query logic with visualization logic).

I have not tested *anything* so far! So please check if something broke on the way.

motivation: currently the MessageConsumer end handler is called only when consumer is unregistered during an event bus close. When the consumer is explicitly unregistered it is not called. This handler is mainly used by RxJava and Kotlin coroutines and it seems it would be best to call the end handler in all case to give an opportunity to end the treatment. In RxJava it would call the complete handler and in Kotlin it would close the underlying channel (so a for each iteration on the channel would terminate and execute the code after).  change: call the MessageConsumer end handler when the MessageConsumer is unregistered explictly.,inline,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Combine two methods into getReplacementText.  Previously  FileEpisode had """"getNewFilename""""  which would construct a new filename out of downloaded information    if  in fact  that information was successfully obtained.  The method would return various other pieces of text in the case where we didn t yet have sufficient information.  Then we had  getNewFilePath  which took the result of getNewFilename and  if """"move"""" was enabled  prepended the destination directory.  getNewFilename was useful as a public function in two places: (1) when we first create the table item  we assume we won t yet have have the file information  so we called getNewFilename to get the placeholder text  and then registered a listener to change it when we had the information (2) in the FileEpisodeTest  we want to validate the name without the destination directory getting in the way  (1) is solved by simply having the placeholder texts be returned by the combined method.  (2) was already solved  by always disabling """"move"""" for those tests  the returned text will never have the directory prepended.  As far as a name goes  neither getNewFilename nor getNewFilePath were really accurate  since it could very well return a different type of text  so I m settling on """"getReplacementText"""".  Possibly that name could still be improved. ",inline,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Add initial support for MOM to 1516e  Many of the values are not currently supported  but the basics are now complete for 1516e MOM support  including the proper serialization of those attribtutes of `HLAfederate` and `HLAfederation` that are supported.

Remove the need for explicit row locks when allocating UIDs.  The existing code with explicit row locks exhibited very poor performance  and also prevented multiple TSDs from allocating UIDs concurrently.  The new approach consists in:   1. Performing an atomic increment to grab a new UID.   2. CAS ing (CompareAndSet) the reverse mapping (uid  > name)   3. CAS ing the forward mapping (name  > uid)  If we die after step 1  we waste an UID.  If we die after step 2  we just end up with an orphaned reverse mapping (harmless).  When two TSDs race to assign a UID to the same name  one of them will fail to CAS the forward mapping at step 3  and will retry to find the UID assigned by the winning TSD.  When that occurs  the only net consequence is that a UID will have been wasted by the losing TSD  whereas the previous implementation wouldn t waste one when this happened.  The  uid fsck  command can easily detect orphaned or wasted UIDs  and we could conceivably put them on some kind of a free list in the future to re allocate them.  If two TSDs are running side by side  and one uses the old method while the other uses the new lock less method  things still work as expected.  There are two possible scenarios:     Old TSD goes first  locks the MAXID row  and does its thing.     The new TSD will have to wait until the row lock is released     for its atomic increment to go through.     The new TSD goes first  atomically increments the MAXID row      and does its thing.  The second TSD locks the MAXID row and     proceeds to allocate its own ID concurrently.,inline,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fix  773   Add global_annotations to graphs  Fixed a bug in which global_annotations were ignored by GraphHandler.java (and thus  were not rendered by gnuplot).

Border Radius Implementation  Heres is full border radius support. Known Issues that should be patched prior to a release are as follows:   Set px value under shorthand BORDER_RADIUS is not computed correctly   Declarations around the CSSName.BORDER_****_RADIUS should be cleaned up and re organized to be more logical and return consistant types to the BorderRadiusCorner class   BorderRadius sides are not automatically fixed when the total radius of one side excedes its width/height. This will need to be completed after the CSS parsing issues have been resolved. (you can observe this by setting border radius: 100%  they should be normailzed to 50% because 1 side cannot have over 100%...).

Major refactoring of dropwizard kafka  New Consumer API:    * `KafkaConsumer` is now parameterized by the message type.   * Consumption now begins when `KafkaConsumer start()` is called.   * During initialization  a `Decoder<T>` and `StreamProcessor<T>` needs   to be registered before the `KafkaConsumer<T>` can be constructed.    This makes construction type safe; it s not possible to create a   `KafkaConsumer<T>` (via `KafkaConsumerFactory`) that isn t valid.   * Scala support updated and simplified.   * Removed cumbersome `ErrorPolicy` configuration in favour of   automatic handling of errors.    Instead of treating all errors the same  we now attempt to recover   from transient errors.  Still TODO:    * Error handling mechanism in `Decoder` instances.

"Massive refactoring to exception handling. I m trying to simplify things  but they are currently a little bit more complicated. I ll do another round shortly.  The main benefit of this change is that now all of our error handling flows through one class: Errors.java.   It takes care of     managing the current source line     managing the current InjectionPoint    building Messages    toStrings  Because of this refactoring we now use almost exactly the same code for both ProvisionException and CreationException. The consequence of this is that ProvisionExceptions now include a full error report    all of the classes injected. """"Fail fast  but not too fast"""" now applies to Provide time as well as Injector create time.  I also made InjectionPoint into a public class in SPI. It replaces dependency. I like this change because """"dependency"""" is a very abstract name  whereas InjectionPoint is very Guicey. Guice injects stuff. Dependencies are a consequence of this  but I like the API better exposing the core Guice abstractions directly.  This entire change needs further doc  simplification and cleanup.

Do work inside getMoveToPath  Previously  FileEpisode had two methods: a private one called getMoveToDirectory  which composed a String from the user specified destination directory  replacement template  and the information we ve found about the file; and a public one caleld getMoveToPath  which basically called getMoveToDirectory and turned the result into a Path.  This made some sense since we work with Strings a lot: all the various components are Strings  and we need a String to put into the ResultsTable.  Still  the point ultimately is to move the file  so the actual Path is pretty important; plus  using Path.resolve() seems better than concatenating Strings with FILE_SEPARATOR_STRING.  We still need the Strings.  But switch it around: create the Path object  and use toString() to get the String version.,inline,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(This also incidentally fixes a tiny bug: https://github.com/google/truth/blob/ca04f65b91a931c887e98f7062288ce2298b62cd/core/src/test/java/com/google/common/truth/ObjectArraySubjectTest.java L345)Most of the new code in Subject is copied from: PrimitiveByteArraySubject (base16) PrimitiveDoubleArraySubject (doubleArrayAsString) PrimitiveFloatArraySubject (floatArrayAsString) ObjectArraySubject (stringableIterable STRINGIFY checkArrayEqualsRecursive) with minor modifications to use the double/byte methodsBut there are some changes: actualEquals is now describeDifference which returns a string rather than a boolean. I use that string to display the index at which arrays differ and to include both the [1 2 3] and 010203 formats for byte arrays. I ve added formatActualOrExpected which is like actualCustomStringRepresentation but is applied to the expected value as well as the actual. I ve added actualCustomStringRepresentationForPackageMembersToCall which I ve just realized our the float[]/double[] subjects  IterableSubjectWithInheritedToString can call instead of reimplementing it.Fixes https://github.com/google/truth/issues/335Fixes https://github.com/google/truth/pull/336Relnotes: Made `assertThat(array).isEqualTo(otherArray)` compare arrays contents (not array identity) even when the input wasn t statically known to be an array. Tweaked the format of array failure messages.

Massive refactors. This list isn t complete  but should give you an idea:  A) many things in lombok.eclipse moved to lombok.core to enable reuse with lombok.javac.  B) lombok.javac works now similarly to eclipse s model: We first make big ASTs that are bidirectionally traversable  then we walk through that for annotations.  C) Instead of getting an annotation instance  you now get an object that is more flexible and can e.g. give you class values in an enum as a string instead of a Class object  which may fail if that class isn t on the classpath of lombok.

"Consolidate SenateSiteDumpId class  Previously  there were several types of SenateSiteDumpId that id ed several different types of dump.  Each of these was reflected in an implementation of SenateSiteDumpId.  For simplicity s sake  we reduced this to one single type of dump: the year/session dump.  This commit simplifies the SenateSiteDumpId class and all of its uses to only handle this one case.    Remove SenateSiteDumpSessionId.   Add dumpTime and year fields to SenateSiteDumpId.   Modify Json parsing classes to read the """"year"""" field instead of   """"session"""" to reflect changes in dump code.   Remove range abstract method.  This was primarily used to get updates   ranges and to get a reference date time (the end of the date range).   The updates ranges are no longer used and the reference date time can   be determined by the dumpTime field.

Hopefully the last of the big exceptions refactorings. I went through all of the places we re adding context to our Errors object and made sure we re never doubling up    specifing the same injection point or key multiple times.  The new errors have nice  at  lines for parameters  fields and linked bindings. Hopefully this makes it easier to follow the stacktraces. Additional context (such as the binding s origin in a module) could be added later if desired. Currently we have module specific sources in CreationExceptions  and plain old binding sources elsewhere. The end result is messages that can look like this:  com.google.inject.ProvisionException: Guice provision errors:  1) Error injecting constructor  java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException   at com.google.inject.ProvisionExceptionTest$RealD.<init>(ProvisionExceptionTest.java:284)   at binding for com.google.inject.ProvisionExceptionTest$RealD.class(ProvisionExceptionTest.java:284)   at binding for com.google.inject.ProvisionExceptionTest$D.class(ProvisionExceptionTest.java:1)  1 error  git svn id: https://google guice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@652 d779f126 a31b 0410 b53b 1d3aecad763e,pull up,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Bugfix: JENKINS 10638 Enhancement: JENKINS 10637 Bugfix: JENKINS 10719  including    New feature: Ignore parent stream   can now tell a project to ignore changes made in the basis stream of the actual stream being built.  This can signficantly reduce the time the plugin takes talking to the accurev server.    New feature: Get streams singly   more of an accurev client workaround really; the plugin used to call the server and get """"the streams"""" which included absolutely everything under the sun  and this turns into many megabytes of data  every poll and every build.  This server setting says to get just the streams we care about (our stream  our parent stream etc)  albeit at the cost of potentially making more than one call to the server. Enhancement: Logging improved  which should make debugging accurev client failures a little easier. Enhancement: Now weakly caches the XmlPullParserFactory. Refactor: Extracted out code that runs the accurev client command into its own class  reducing duplicated code and making parsing of command output more consistent. Refactor: Split out many of AccurevSCM s inner classes into their own files in an attempt to make the main class more maintainable.

Factor out common unit test code. It looks like the code might have been designed to be more generic but was never abstracted. I know that the swing interface to JUnit  JRunnder  sometimes causes problems since it uses its own class loaded.

Extract the main bindingimpl/factory implementation of ProviderMethod into an abstract base class.  This is a prefactoring for moving multibinders into the core.  All the multibinder factories will share a lot in common with ProviderMethods * They are ProviderInstanceBindings * The providers implement ProviderWithExtensions * The  userSuppliedProvider  is a bit of a misnomer  so we provide a standard   implementation  This also removes the ProviderLookups from every ProviderMethod  which were pretty much unneeded.

Commiting the code of v1.3    New Features: Custom commands now use my parser Added entity data (e.g. one can now use angry wolves  powered creepers  different villagers  etc.) Added a /skript reload command to reload the main config and all scripts Added expressions  last spawned entity  and  line   of <block>   whereas the latter can currently only be read and cleared  but not set    Changes:  Trigger files  are now called  scripts   end in  .sk  and are located in the  scripts/  folder The main config also now ends in  .sk  Variables are now stored in a csv file Merged right and leftclick into one event such that one can now use  on click on ...   The entity/player/etc.  cannot be used in damage events anymore  one has to use  attacker  or  victim  respectively Several changes in the API  e.g. removed LoopExpr   all expressions can now be looped Block loops now loop from bottom to top and not from left to right (whatever  left  or  right  is)  Argument    can now also be accessed as  argument <type>  or  <type> argument   e.g.  arg player  or  player argument   Targeted block  is now stored during an event  resulting in faster execution and no unexpected results when changing any blocks in the player s LOS. The current targeted block can still be accessed with  future targeted block  or  targeted block will be/will not be/etc. .    Fixes: Fixed CheckedIterator and BlockSphereIterator (and AABB for that matter) Skript now throws an error if it is reloaded by some plugin manager that doesn t reload the plugin like CraftBukkit does Fixed inventory handling  e.g.  can hold  does not change the inventory anymore Improved the handling of items that have multiple IDs  e.g. cauldron block/item or redstone torch on/off The parser doesn t exit anymore if an expression s init() method printed an error  allowing for more complex patterns Fixed expressions   and  state   most expressions don t even have it and others inherit it from others Fixed furnace slots Fixed clickint on air not being checked for being cancelled by other plugins correctly Fixed clicking on an entity causing 2 click events   one for the entity and one for air Fixed ambiguity of variables that have expressions in their name Fixed not being able to heal or damage an entity by    hearts  Fixed the expression    of <item>  conflicting with ItemType s    of <alias>  And many other small fixes    Drafts: Added drafts for unit testing    Known Issues: The default location of many block events is at an entity and vice versa. I know the cause but not how to fix this tidily.

Refactored Operations to improve correctness of vbucket aware ops  Previously we had operations that implemented classes that they should not have been implemented. For example  there were ASCII operations that implementing the VBucketAware interface. Since ASCII operations must go through moxi and don t contain vbucket numbers there is no reason for them to implement this interface.  This commit also contains the addition of SingleKeyOperationImpl and MultiKeyOperationImpl which subclass OperationImpl and are superclasses to binary operations that contain one or more keys correspondingly. This abstraction allows these type of operations to deal with vBucket awareness and the amount of keys the operation contains in different ways.

Extended the code in the iconio package   Added read support for new style icons with embedded pngs   Added write support to ICOFile  in most cases the output matches the input 100%   I/O now done with LGM s StreamDecoder/Encoder   GmFile now stores which version it represents   At the moment  this is only used to determine whether the game icon needs modifying   If game version < 8 when it is to be written  icon is reduced to a single image with size and colour depth <  32x32 @ 32bpp  GmFileReader was fixed so that GM8 files with more than one resource of a given type load correctly   Inflater finished in wrong scope   ver was reused and hence was tested before it was assigned the value 800 again  Added StreamDecoder and separated GmStreamDecoder from it   StreamDecoder subclasses InputStream for convenience   Changed the system for inflating    Rather than spawning a new GmStreamDecoder  the current one simply changes state.    When entering inflater mode  the current file position is recorded and then reset to 0. This allows file position to be displayed as <position of zlib block>[<position in inflated data>] for easier debugging. Ending the inflater restores the original file position.   read(byte[] int int) now guarantees the requested number of bytes will be read unless EOF is reached   BufferedInputStream guarantees this but InflaterInputStream does not  StreamEncoder now subclasses OutputStream for convenience  git svn id: https://lateralgm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lateralgm/LateralGM/trunk@390 8f422083 7f27 0410 bc82 93e204be8cd2,pull up,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Refactorings: * Got rid of ComponentSuiteResolver  because the ComponentSuiteRegistry has to be filled in advance  anyway  and this is what the IDEA plugin now also does. Simplified ComponentSuiteRegistry accordingly. * Split XmlToJsonHandler used for all EXML parsing into two handlers  one for the metadata (ExmlToMetadataHandler) and one for the Ext component JSON (ExmlToJsonHandler). The metadata is needed to (re)build the XSD  the JSON is needed when generating the AS3 class. Opened API to generate a single class. * Removed some too exhaustive logging and a few souts.

Fix missing amendmentVersions on BillSobiProcessor  When the BillActionAnalyzer was changed to fix the bill actions having the wrong amendment version  it created a foerign key problem with the database. A fix was written and was applied to the XmlBillStatProcessor. Unfortunatly  that was not sufficient  because Sobi files also use the BillActionAnalyzer and could be affected by this. The method that fixes this problem has been moved to the AbstractDataProcessor so it can be accessed by both processors.

"Change show hierarchy  It uses to go like this:   ShowOption extends Object   Show extends ShowOption   LocalShow extends Show   FailedShow extends LocalShow  Now  it goes like this:   ShowOption extends Object   FailedShow extends ShowOption   Show    formerly LocalShow    extends ShowOption   Series    formerly Show    extends Show  So  places that are supposed to be able to take either a FailedShow or a Show now must accept a ShowOption.  But other places that still take a Show  can now be guaranteed that the object they get is not a FailedShow.  As mentioned  the class that is now """"Show"""" is what used to be a """"LocalShow"""".  Reversing the inheritance makes more sense.  There is no place that took a LocalShow but couldn t use a (provider recognized) Show.  But classes like ListingsLookup only make sense with a non local show.  Now it uses """"Series""""  so there is no worry about it getting a non Series Show.  A FileEpisode no longer accepts a FailedShow.  When we fail to get a Show to map to the FileEpisode  we call setEpisodeShow() with null  which updates the seriesStatus.  We no longer have to check for having a FailedShow in the actualShow slot  though we still need to check for it being null.  When we re using instances of Series  also change variables and comments to refer to """"series"""" rather than """"show"""".

JCBC 674: API for prepared statements  Motivation            In N1QL dp4  prepared statements are a bit different from parametrized statements. Executing a prepared statement requires two steps: obtain the query plan then later on execute the query plan.  Modifications               Added classes to represent a PREPARE Statement (the one for step 1  that allows to obtain an execution plan)  and the QueryPlan itself.  PreparedQuery now uses the QueryPlan and can value parameters.  Added methods on (Async)Bucket to obtain a QueryPlan from a PrepareStatement (step 2 is just using a PreparedQuery in the existing method).  Refactored the various Query classes with a common base AbstractQuery  fixed the unit tests in QueryToN1qlTest.  Added an integration test for Queries (work in progress).  Result        Users can now obtain a QueryPlan from a Statement and execute said plan.

JCBC 678: support more parameters for N1QL query  Motivation            It makes sense that some request parameters from N1QL specification be tuned by the user. Offer an API to do that for relevant parameters.  Modifications               Added QueryParams  following the Parameter Object pattern  to allow to set various relevant query parameters for N1QL. Added consistency enum.  Added unit tests to check the produced JSON query and the coherence of the API.  Added method on JsonObject to remove an entry from the JSON  by key.  Result        Users now can further tune their N1QL queries with relevant parameters.

Refactored and optimized batch vertex caches impls  This commit pulls common batch loading vertex cache code into AbstractIDVertexCache and makes String and ObjectIDVertexCache extend that abstract base class.  LongIDVertexCache uses Colt primitive collections internally and is not amenable to sharing code with the other Java collections based implementations.  This commit also applies the optimization from a0cf0f11d8c4eaf436493f742789142d741ac06e to Object and LongIDVertexCache.

Node attributes editor has correct functionality.  The functionality is not complete  but everything that s there seems to work correctly. You can add parameters  change types  set min/max values etc.  This also required changes in Parameter  where we better handle type migration.  Also  you can view (but not change) the node ports.

Do not ignore if an mp is tagged with name only  This is a partly revert of r2478. mkgmap used the tags of the outer polygons if the mp itself was tagged with name only. This is a common tagging error. But this tolerant handling produced some errors. So revert this. This commit also fixes the handling of mps with tags removed by the loader. r2478 removed this detection by mistake.  git svn id: http://svn.mkgmap.org.uk/mkgmap/trunk@2483 25d90789 57f7 4ee0 8453 03a3dfeeeb22,pull up,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Replaced `WeakReference` resource references with a new class  `ResourceReference`. This should fix most of  33.  * Each resource now holds its own reference in a `public final` field. In the constructor  it can either take a reference as a parameter (and optionally update it)  or it can make a new reference.  * The access to the constructor and `set` method in `ResourceReference` is intentionally restricted to let only classes in the `resources` package handle them.  * Fixed handling of `null` references in several places.  * Removed `Util.refsAreEqual` since references should be unique and thus can be compared using `  `.  * Made `ResNode.res` final  since this field shouldn t change. The reference will update itself.  * Added a new method  `dispose`  to `Resource`  which `null`s its reference  signalling that the resource has been removed.  * Reorganized `copy` methods used by resources.   * Resources implement a single `protected` method for all copying  which is used by two methods in `Resource`:    * `copy(ResourceList<R> src)`  which should do the same as before.    * `clone()`  which makes an exact deep copy of the resource  with the same reference. The reference can later be updated to point to this new clone.   * Note that the `update` parameter now has a different meaning: to update the given reference to point to the new resource (as in the constructor).  * Moved the `UpdateSource` system from `Resource` to `ResourceReference`.

Proof of concept: spawn Mojang structures in BO3s  It is now possible to spawn a Minecraft object (like minecraft:igloo/igloo_bottom) using MinecraftObject(x y z name) in a BO3.  Objects added by mods are not yet supported. This requires the BO3 config to know about all existing objects  which the current TerrainControl code doesn t yet support. A little refactoring is needed here.  These Minecraft objects are called structures by Mojang. To distinguish them from the complete structures  they are called structure parts in the code.  These new objects are represented by the interface called SpawnableObject. CustomObject now extends this interface. See the JavaDocs of both for more details.  The StructuredCustomObject interface has been removed  the methods are now in CustomObject. This eliminates the need of ugly code like this:  Branch[] branches   (object instanceof StructuredCustomObject)? ((StructuredCustomObject) object).getBranches() : new Branch[0];  Now the code is simply:  Branch[] branches   object.getBranches();,pull up,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

simplify sources which implement osm format readers  mo effect on output expected.    remove interface LoadableOsmDataSource   remove input format specific (pbf o5m xml) implementations of OsmMapDataSource   OsmMapDataSource now implements LoadableMapDataSource and decides which parser is to use  These changes allow to remove various sources. A few classes were renamed to remove the format specific parts in the name. Osm5XmlHandler was renamed to OsmXmlHandler (no idea what the 5 meant  I always confuse it with 05m)   A side effect of these changes is that the   coastlinefile option now accepts o5m format as input  but maybe the option should be removed as well.

JCBC 938: Multi values in array mutations  (this is still an in design part of RFC 002  subdoc API)  Motivation:             RFC 002 introduces the possibility to insert multiple values at once in an existing array. This is the implementation of this part of the RFC.  Modifications:                A new internal type  MultiValue  is introduced to facilitate the special encoding needed for multi valued array mutations.  FragmentTranscoder now has two abstract methods: one is the classic encoding path  the other is the MultiValue encoding path.  3 new specs have been added to the subdoc builders: arrayPrependAll  arrayAppendAll and arrayInsertAll. Each of these takes a Collection of values. A convenience alternative signature using varargs is also offered for each (but doesn t offer the createParents parameter).  The different naming (xxxAll suffix) allows to disambiguate some edge cases relative to varargs for the compiler. It is also close to the java collections idiom.  Results:          Multi valued inserts are now possible in the Java subdoc API  using either a Collection or a vararg enumeration. Tests have been adapted.

Cleanup and fix several issues. 1) Abstracted ResNode from a DefaultNode that can be used with other tree models. 2) Added contitional checking for if resources were changed  whenver you close a frame it will check for changes and store that in the resource. The global check for changes method will iterate all open frames and all resources in the resource map asking if they have changes. 3) Number two led me back to the issue for wrong refernces to Game Info/Settings after load  I have identified the cause and applied a temporary patch. 4) Added the foundation for searching in resources and also placed the event panel in a tab in this area  what s interesting is that I have noticed that if the toolbar for it is set floatable and you float it out it will take the tab with it and it can still be redocked.

This update completes https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DPS 88: it adds  Manifest REST API call to Durastore.  Essentially what happened here is that the mill jpa repo module was moved over from the mill project  the manifest rest and resource classes were moved from duraboss to durastore  and a new ManifestGeneratorImpl was written that works with the ManifestStore. This new setup depends on a property in the CATALINA_OPTS pointing to a properties file containing the properties specified in mill jpa repo/src/test/resources/mill config.properties.

Transfer sponsors for new active amendment.  Modifies bill processor code to transfer sponsors when the active amendment changes.  Sponsors are already copied when an amendment is first created  but this was not enough in cases where new amendments were not immediately published or previous amendments were restored as active.  A unit test was added to test co/multi sponsor processing in these cases.  Additionally some refactoring was done on bill processors:    Consolidate xml and bill action parsing code because they parse   actions in the same format.   Reorganize xml billstat processor in an attempt to have a cleaner    easier to understand workflow.

Refactored Rule base classes around Rule interface instead of around AST Visitor interfaces.  Long term goal is to support additional languages beyond Java.

This is a start  there s a much larger reorganizing effort to get things in sync.

A bit of work on the symbol table class names are now recorded in the GlobalScope.

Generalize RuleViolation treatment. Add abstract base class and language specific rule violation implementations. To be consistent with other PMD code renamed IRuleViolation to RuleViolation (I never liked this Hungarian notation crap in Java code anyway).

Changed Report to use a List of violations internally instead of a Set since the change to the RuleViolationComparator was causing truly duplicate RuleViolations to be dropped. git svn id: https://pmd.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pmd/trunk@5946 51baf565 9d33 0410 a72c fc3788e3496d,push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improve BiomeGenerator and BiomeCache handling The BiomeCache class has it s implementation moved to Common. Our cache is more efficient for our needs than Mojang s cache as it can better handle virtual biomes. Our cache has very similar API to Mojang s cache for now. Previously there was a biome generator called VanillaBiomeGenerator that had to be special cased. Now it s up to the implementation of TC Common (either TC Bukkit or TC Forge) to register a vanilla biome generator that properly implements BiomeGenerator. There is one area left where the VanillaBiomeGenerator should still be special cased. [Bukkit/Forge]VanillaBiomeGenerator gets its information from Mojang s WorldChunkManager. The Biome(Gen)Base arrays are converted to int arrays. If you would use TCWorldChunkManager (extends WorldChunkManager) to get information from the BiomeGenerator you would get infinite recursion. To make the code more maintainable a check has been added to the [Forge/Bukkit]VanillaBiomeGenerator classes (as well as documentation to the class).,push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hopefully the last of the big exceptions refactorings. I went through all of the places we re adding context to our Errors object and made sure we re never doubling up    specifing the same injection point or key multiple times.  The new errors have nice  at  lines for parameters  fields and linked bindings. Hopefully this makes it easier to follow the stacktraces. Additional context (such as the binding s origin in a module) could be added later if desired. Currently we have module specific sources in CreationExceptions  and plain old binding sources elsewhere. The end result is messages that can look like this:  com.google.inject.ProvisionException: Guice provision errors:  1) Error injecting constructor  java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException   at com.google.inject.ProvisionExceptionTest$RealD.<init>(ProvisionExceptionTest.java:284)   at binding for com.google.inject.ProvisionExceptionTest$RealD.class(ProvisionExceptionTest.java:284)   at binding for com.google.inject.ProvisionExceptionTest$D.class(ProvisionExceptionTest.java:1)  1 error  git svn id: https://google guice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@652 d779f126 a31b 0410 b53b 1d3aecad763e,push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"exploit new  sourcepath option   removed all """"guessing"""": no more guessing of members  classes and type casts (removed the corresponding compiler options too). The """"downside"""" is that all imports must be accessible and  parseable at compile time. This means that we will also need something like a  classpath before we can use this inside our maven plugin to resolve dependencies on Jangaroo libraries. The upside: jooc warnings should be taken seriously now! Splitted analyze() phase into scope() and analyze() changed parser to parse dotted identifier sequences as QalifiedIde and increased priority of new operator to be higher than dot: new a.b.c().d is now correctly parsed as dot(new(ideexpr(qide(""""a.b.c""""))) """"d"""") handled all code generation for qualified and unqualified ide expressions in Ide and QualifiedIde generateCodeAsExpr()   no more tree rewriting in DotExpr and elsewhere (i think we can remove the parent node slot in AstNodes and change the return type of analyze() to void code generation now adds the package prefix for imported identifiers and the $$private prefix for private static members.

"Rework surface generators  The biggest change is that they are now run during terrain generation instead of population.  Previously the SurfaceBlock/GroundBlock would be generated by ChunkProviderTC and then overwritten by the SurfaceGenerator during terrain population. Now the SurfaceGenerator is responsible for generating SurfaceBlock/GroundBlock.  NullSurfaceGenerator is now called SimpleSurfaceGenerator (as it now generates SurfaceBlock/GroundBlock)  and the old SimpleSurfaceGenerator is now called MultipleLayersSurfaceGenerator.  GeneratingChunk has been added as an object to hold various data about a chunk being generated. ChunkProviderTC still uses its """"temporary class fields""""  I hope to refactor this class in the future to use GeneratingChunk everywhere.

Extensive refactor of the entire upload codebase  to assist with code cleanliness  and pave the way for further work.    Publisher specific code has been refactored extensively. Instead of single generator  passing around publisher config factory  each publisher has its own generators for each type of element. This improves testability and separates concerns.    Version and OnDemand generation has been improved. Now all generators are generating versions/ondemands based upon the ids produced by the respective idGenerator.    all configuration switching has been removed from the TvAnytimeFeedsModule  as this has no upload code  so should be enabled all the time.    chunk size has been removed  as it is not being used.,push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Major refactoring.  The jdbc package was in pretty bad shape and was extremely hard to modify.  Some of the changes made to fix this were:   o Refactored the JdbcMigrationContext so that the source of connections is    abstracted.  A BasicDataSource that wraps a connection has been added to    support environments without access to a data source.  o All database specific configuration options are now set on the    JdbcMigrationContext.  The patch path is set on the migration launcher.  o Fixed the way that database connections were being closed.  The old way    caused pooled datasources to hang.  o Less connection passing: every class can obtain its connection from the context  o Put the concept formerly known as dialect into it s own class: DatabaseType  o Added support for Oracle.  This turned out to be a pain since the Oracle JDBC    driver doesn t support multiple statements in a single Statement.execute call like    Postgres does.  o Renaming: many of the old names didn t make sense.  I tried to make the changes as backwards compatible as possible  but I haven t tested this with an existing application.  You have been warned.  This whole thing needs to be repackaged under net.sf.autopatch at some point.,push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fixes  56   Back end of Outputters revised. The mechanism for output formatting is now independent of the output destination  e.g.  there is no longer any  formatting  logic in the Outputters  but it s all in the  Walkers . Rearrange code structures to take the  support  classes to a different package. This  cleans  up the regular org.jdom2.output package. The support package should only be of interest to people who override/subclass/customize the default functionality. I will put a wiki page together on the new details  and how overriders/customizers can benefit from the the structures.,push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Refactoring the AffinityMatrixCreator to be an interface and create a new SimilarityFunction interface.  Additionally  any class using the WorkQueue now all use the same singleton WorkQueue  as opposed to their own.     The two affinity matrix edge selection methods are now different     implementations of AffinityMatrixCreator.     Each AffinityMatrixCreator takes in two SimilarityFunctions  one for     selecting edges and one for weighting edges.     Any classes using AffinityMatrixCreator have been updated to use the     interface and take in a pre constructed AffinityMatrixCreator as an argument     The LPP based mains have been simplified to create AffinityMatrixCreators     Every similarity method in Similarity has a corresponding SimilarityFunction     The kernel functions from AffinityMatrixCreator also have a corresponding     SimilarityFunction     A bug fix in HashBiMap is fixed that caused infinite puts     Minor spacing or javadoc fixes as needed     WorkQueue is now a singleton class.  Any threaded classes using the queue     now access the same queue and submit runnable s to it so that no job queues     are conflicting.

A bit of work on the symbol table   class names are now recorded in the GlobalScope.

Extended the code in the iconio package   Added read support for new style icons with embedded pngs   Added write support to ICOFile  in most cases the output matches the input 100%   I/O now done with LGM s StreamDecoder/Encoder   GmFile now stores which version it represents   At the moment  this is only used to determine whether the game icon needs modifying   If game version < 8 when it is to be written  icon is reduced to a single image with size and colour depth <  32x32 @ 32bpp  GmFileReader was fixed so that GM8 files with more than one resource of a given type load correctly   Inflater finished in wrong scope   ver was reused and hence was tested before it was assigned the value 800 again  Added StreamDecoder and separated GmStreamDecoder from it   StreamDecoder subclasses InputStream for convenience   Changed the system for inflating    Rather than spawning a new GmStreamDecoder  the current one simply changes state.    When entering inflater mode  the current file position is recorded and then reset to 0. This allows file position to be displayed as <position of zlib block>[<position in inflated data>] for easier debugging. Ending the inflater restores the original file position.   read(byte[] int int) now guarantees the requested number of bytes will be read unless EOF is reached   BufferedInputStream guarantees this but InflaterInputStream does not  StreamEncoder now subclasses OutputStream for convenience  git svn id: https://lateralgm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lateralgm/LateralGM/trunk@390 8f422083 7f27 0410 bc82 93e204be8cd2,push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Added support for JDBC3.  The driver will now build under JDBC3 (i.e. Java 1.4). This concludes my changes that restructured the code to support JDBC3. The jdbc unit tests were also resturctured to allow different tests between jdbc2 and jdbc3  although currently make check (aka ant test) for JDBC3 just runs the JDBC2 tests.  Of special note the largeobject/PGblob and PGclob classes have been moved under the jdbc2/jdbc3 specific directories as they now differ by jdbc version.  Also note that this checkin removes the PostgresqlDataSource and files in the xa directory.  A recent checkin has added new datasource support that replaces the functionality provided by these classes.

"Change show hierarchy  It uses to go like this:   ShowOption extends Object   Show extends ShowOption   LocalShow extends Show   FailedShow extends LocalShow  Now  it goes like this:   ShowOption extends Object   FailedShow extends ShowOption   Show    formerly LocalShow    extends ShowOption   Series    formerly Show    extends Show  So  places that are supposed to be able to take either a FailedShow or a Show now must accept a ShowOption.  But other places that still take a Show  can now be guaranteed that the object they get is not a FailedShow.  As mentioned  the class that is now """"Show"""" is what used to be a """"LocalShow"""".  Reversing the inheritance makes more sense.  There is no place that took a LocalShow but couldn t use a (provider recognized) Show.  But classes like ListingsLookup only make sense with a non local show.  Now it uses """"Series""""  so there is no worry about it getting a non Series Show.  A FileEpisode no longer accepts a FailedShow.  When we fail to get a Show to map to the FileEpisode  we call setEpisodeShow() with null  which updates the seriesStatus.  We no longer have to check for having a FailedShow in the actualShow slot  though we still need to check for it being null.  When we re using instances of Series  also change variables and comments to refer to """"series"""" rather than """"show"""". ",push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Change configuration format to get rid of settings on OutputWriters. Instead be explicit about settings for each output writer. This should allow to simplify quite a bit the code related to settings  have OutputWriter self document their options (well  you still have to look at the code).  While the code compiles and should be iso functional  this refactoring is not completed yet. Only BaseOutputWriter has been refactored (with impacts on others classes). More work needs to be performed.  The refactoring is backward compatible. This introduces a bit too much work in the constructor  which is not terribly readable. Partly that s the price to pay for backward compatibility  partly this could be cleaned up and abstracted away.,push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a start  there s a much larger reorganizing effort to get things in sync.

"Redo substitution resolving to better handle complex cases.  The main idea of this patch is to introduce """"partial resolution"""" which means resolving only the minimum branch of the object tree to get to a desired value. By using partial resolution whenever possible  more interdependencies between substitutions are permitted.  ConfigDelayedMergeObject was a big problem because a lot of the code in AbstractConfigObject really didn t work on it  because it assumed a resolved object; much of that code now moves down to SimpleConfigObject.

Extracted a very unecessary dependency on java.util.URI.  74.  This is probably the bigest change ever refactored on the system. The URI class was nested deep into the system for no real reason. It was assumed that all backends would have a URI scheme  and that we keep the URI at all times on all buckets. This was not the case  and everything from the Bucket model to the PathResolver had to be refactored.  The change was made in the first place because glacier does not have a URI that we can just call. Instead we want to configure each backend with key values instead of with URI s.  This change to the system should also make it easier to transition into a key value store  since the abstraction for transfering buckets is   give this bucket this key  and when I give you the key again then give me back my bucket .,push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improve BiomeGenerator and BiomeCache handling  The BiomeCache class has it s implementation moved to Common. Our cache is more efficient for our needs than Mojang s cache  as it can better handle virtual biomes. Our cache has very similar API to Mojang s cache for now.  Previously  there was a biome generator called VanillaBiomeGenerator that had to be special cased. Now it s up to the implementation of TC Common (either TC Bukkit or TC Forge) to register a vanilla biome generator that properly implements BiomeGenerator.  There is one area left where the VanillaBiomeGenerator should still be special cased. [Bukkit/Forge]VanillaBiomeGenerator gets its information from Mojang s WorldChunkManager. The Biome(Gen)Base arrays are converted to int arrays. If you would use TCWorldChunkManager (extends WorldChunkManager) to get information from the BiomeGenerator  you would get infinite recursion.  To make the code more maintainable  a check has been added to the [Forge/Bukkit]VanillaBiomeGenerator classes (as well as documentation to the class).,push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generalize RuleViolation treatment.  Add abstract base class  and language specific rule violation implementations.  To be consistent with other PMD code  renamed IRuleViolation to RuleViolation (I never liked this Hungarian notation crap in Java code anyway).  Extracted the RuleViolationComparator as a standalone class  and fixed it s implementation (was seriously broken) so the RuleViolation comparison is very well defined.  Changed Report to use a List of violations internally  instead of a Set  since the change to the RuleViolationComparator was causing truly duplicate RuleViolations to be dropped.  git svn id: https://pmd.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pmd/trunk@5946 51baf565 9d33 0410 a72c fc3788e3496d,push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Corrects the dependencies management. 1) Redefines the goals where the dependencies are downloaded and unpack  and avoid doing so several times.   Phase initialize   goal nar download : download all the project dependencies in the local maven repository.   Phase generate sources   goal nar unpack : unpack in the project target folder (sub folder nar) the NAR files needed for compilation.   Phase generate test sources   goal nar test unpack : unpack in the project target folder (sub folder test nar) the NAR files needed for tests compilations  for tests executions  and for executions.  2) Removes the execution of the goal nar prepare package on the phase generate test sources  this was needed to get the correct library name for tests compilation if the property output was used to rename the library. The test compilation Mojo now gets the correct name without the need to run nar prepare package.  3) On test compilation don t link the dependencies which are static libraries as they are already included in the library for which we are building the test executable.  4) Corrects the following error : The SNAPSHOT libraries are stored on web repositories with the string """"SNAPSHOT"""" in the version number replaced by a timestamp based number. If a project uses a SNAPSHOT library which is on a web repository and not yet on the local repository  and defines this dependency with a scope different than compile or test  the NAR files are unpacked in the target folder of the project without changing back the timestamp to """"SNAPSHOT""""  causing compilation errors as the dependency files are looked in """"SNAPSHOT"""" directories. Example :   Library with artifactId """"inetfunc"""" and version """"1.0 SNAPSHOT"""".   Stored in Sonatype Nexus repository as   > inetfunc 1.0 20150329.212547 2.nar  > inetfunc 1.0 20150329.212547 2 noarch.nar  > inetfunc 1.0 20150329.212547 2 amd64 Windows gpp static.nar   Downloaded in local maven repository as  > inetfunc 1.0 20150329.212547 2.nar  > inetfunc 1.0 20150329.212547 2 noarch.nar  > inetfunc 1.0 20150329.212547 2 amd64 Windows gpp static.nar   Renamed in local maven repository as (good here)  > inetfunc 1.0 SNAPSHOT.nar  > inetfunc 1.0 SNAPSHOT noarch.nar  > inetfunc 1.0 SNAPSHOT amd64 Windows gpp static.nar   Unpacked in the project target folder as  > inetfunc 1.0 20150329.212547 2 noarch  > inetfunc 1.0 20150329.212547 2 amd64 Windows gpp static ",push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LILY 364 Introducing smart population of the MQ so that each indexer only receives events about relevant records.  This makes it more efficient to have multiple indexes  especially when each index handles a different subset of the records.  To do this more selective MQ feeding  MessageQueueFeeder is replaced by a new IndexAwareMessageQueueFeeder.  In case the information based on which a record is included in some index changes  the old index(es) of which the record was part still need to receive the event in order to delete the record from their index. Thus  IndexAwareMessageQueueFeeder needs both the old&new values of this information  and this is made available in the RecordEvent by the IndexSelectionRecordUpdateHook  which plugs in in the critical path of the CRUD operations.  There is a new Kauri module called indexer integration which registers the IndexAwareMessageQueueFeeder and IndexSelectionRecordUpdateHook (which needs to be done before the Repository starts).  In the indexerconf  the simple List<IndexCase> is replaced by IndexRecordFilter. The indexerconf.xml <records> section syntax changed (it is now replaced by a <recordFilter>)  but the old syntax stays supported.  All this is still work in progress: the major components are in place and there is a basic testcase  but lots of things left to do.,push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MAJOR refactorin of the models. SiteModel is now an interface  implemented by DefaultSiteModel (the old SiteModel) and FilteredSiteModel (designed for things like the Spider where we don t show the entire view)  or FuzzerModel (which doesn t show the queries)  Spider s model has been factored out of the Spider.java class  and is now standalone Fuzzer (the beginnings of Fuzzer support) also has a proper model. I plan to factor out the model from SessionID and Fragments eventually  too.  Model events are now a proper event class  rather than multiple parameters.,push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fixes for JGRP 1826   Changed PingData: one physical_addr instead of a list of phys addrs   Changed GossipData: one physical_addr instead of a list of phys addrs   Fixed compile error with JDK 8 in MessageDispatcher   Added Responses and test   Replaced MERGE2 with MERGE3 in all sample config files   Removed num_initial_members (deprecated and ignored) from XML config files   MERGE2/MERGE3 now use their own protocol to implement view fetching and doesn t depend on discovery anymore. This allows us to remove the view fetching code from the discovery protocols   Replaced is_server and is_coord with 1 byte flag in PingData   Removed division/zero exception in UPerf   Added keySet() to LazyRemovalCache   Destroying window on close   First shot at CloudBasedDiscovery.txt   Using GMS.join_timeout rather than Discovery.timeout for discovery   Set TCP.use_async_discovery to true in tcp.xml   Protocol: setValue() logs a warning if the field to be set is deprecated   PingData carries an optional list of members for which discovery is requested   Tests for modified PingData   Changed Discovery.findMembers() to accept a members list and populate a Responses object  (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP 1826)   ClientGmsImpl.join() uses FIND_INITIAL_MBRS event and then waits for GMS.join_timeout ms on the returned Responses object   MERGE2 uses FIND_MBRS event and then waits for discovery_timeout ms on the returned Responses object   MERGE3 uses FIND_MBRS event and then waits for discovery_timeout ms on the returned Responses object   TCPGOSSIP/RouterStub: changed signature of findMembers()   Passing async parameter to findMembers() in case async_discovery should be overwritten (e.g. in up(FIND_MBRS ...)   TP: using Responses returned by FIND_MBRS evt sent up   Looping back if target is a physical address and local address    target   SHARED_LOOPBACK_PING.findMembers() changed to the new method   FILE_PING: added a shutdown hook to remove own info in case of a crash   FILE_PING: selectively reading info for listed members in findMembers()   JDBC_PING.findMembers(): add result to Responses as soon as it has been read   RACKSPACE_PING.findMembers(): add result to Responses as soon as it has been read   SWIFT_PING.findMembers(): add result to Responses as soon as it has been read   S3_PING.findMembers(): add result to Responses as soon as it has been read   S3_PING: read members selectively if listed   Set TUNNEL.supportsMulticasting() to true   Removed timeout from discovery protocols  configs   Changed GMS.join_timeout to 2000 in udp.xml and tcp.xml   TP: when IP multicast is not available  sending a message to N 1 members by looking up the IP address for each member. We used to send this to *all* physical addresses in the cache  which was a waste   Sending a multicast (N 1) only sends to members of current cluster. Needed to take shared transports into account   AsciiString: prevent NPE in ctor when string is null   SHARED_LOOPBACK_PING return an empty Responses object if it is the first member in a cluster. This allows the member to become coordinator *immediately* rather than having to wait for GMS.join_timeout ms   Set GMS.max_join_attempts to 10   UNICAST3 only sends a CLOSE to dest if dest is still a member   TP: removed warning for incorrect destination as this might happen a few times (correct)   Added Responses.contains(Address addr)   Fixed Discovery.serializeWithoutView(): didn t add is_coord flag   Changed version to 3.5.0.Beta7,push down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rendered decorator is now passed through the ContentProcessor to  to further process any tags added by the decorator. This allows decorators to be built with tags and treated as content  rather than having bindings for templating languages (JSP  Velocity...).  Some cool side effects of this: * No more never ending list of templating systems to integrate with. * Works in the same way in web apps and offline. * It s just so simple.  Overview of changes: * Introduced SiteMeshWriteTagRule  which handles <sitemesh:write property  body /> definitions in decorators and merges in the content. * <decorate> renamed to <sitemesh:decorate>. * SiteMesh Context object now has a getContentToMerge() method which is used by decorators when they need to get access to the underlying content. * Content now has a  processed  property which is the default output (post processing). Previously this was implicitly  body    just making it more explicit.  Note: This changes introduces a bug and a bunch of test failures around the <title> tag. These will be resolved in a follow up commit (this change is already very big) and will not be pushed upstream until fixed.,rename,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"exploit new  sourcepath option   removed all """"guessing"""": no more guessing of members  classes and type casts (removed the corresponding compiler options too). The """"downside"""" is that all imports must be accessible and  parseable at compile time. This means that we will also need something like a  classpath before we can use this inside our maven plugin to resolve dependencies on Jangaroo libraries. The upside: jooc warnings should be taken seriously now! Splitted analyze() phase into scope() and analyze() changed parser to parse dotted identifier sequences as QalifiedIde and increased priority of new operator to be higher than dot: new a.b.c().d is now correctly parsed as dot(new(ideexpr(qide(""""a.b.c""""))) """"d"""") handled all code generation for qualified and unqualified ide expressions in Ide and QualifiedIde generateCodeAsExpr()   no more tree rewriting in DotExpr and elsewhere (i think we can remove the parent node slot in AstNodes and change the return type of analyze() to void code generation now adds the package prefix for imported identifiers and the $$private prefix for private static members.

Turned AccessNode from the Java AST into an interface as it should be.  Deleted and renamed AST classes as appropriate to following convention in absence of SimpleNode classes.

"Fix a typo (I assume) in one of the failure messages from IterableSubject.containsExactly: it says """"contains only"""" rather than """"contains exactly"""".  I ve done a bit of random tidy up while I was here. For one thing  the private method took a failVerb parameter which always had the same value  so I eliminated that. And that method is more similar to containExactlyElementsIn than it is to containsExactly  so I renamed it (which also means there s no confusion between the private two arg overload the the public varargs overload).

Use ~/.tvrenamer as configuration directory.  Previously  ~/.tvrenamer was an XML file containing preferences  and ~/.tvrenameroverrides was an XML file containing title override information.  I m switching these to ~/.tvrenamer/prefs.xml and ~/.tvrenamer/overrides.xml  respectively.  But to have a directory ~/.tvrenamer  we need to move the file out of the way  create the directory  and then move the file into the directory.  The method initialize() of UserPreferences accomplishes this upon startup.  Use java.nio.file.Path instead of java.io.File.  Keep all of these hard coded items in Constants.java.  Also  eliminate hard coding of overrides in source code.

"  Undid redesign of April 2011. Most importantly  instead of a subclass of java.io.File  OverthereFile is now an abstract base class. Subclassing only made the implementation more complex and added no benefits: any other code used expects to be able to open a FileInputStream or a FileOutputStream to a java.io.File  which won t work for remote files. This change also allows for more specific semantics of delete()  mkdir()  mkdirs()  and renameTo().   Removed API methods that have better alternatives  e.g. use listFiles instead of list.   Removed convenience methods such as get(OutputStream).   Renamed get() to getInputStream() and put(long) to getOutputStream(long).   Renamed HostConnection to OverthereConnection.   Renamed OverhereConnection.startExecute() to OverthereConnection.startProcess().   Renamed CommandExecution to OverthereProcess.   Renamed CommandExecutionCallbackHandler to OverthereProcessOutputHandler.   Improved OverthereProcessOutputHandler implementations: they can now be created using static methods and can be grouped with the MultipleOverthereProcessOutputHandler.   Improved performance of SSH (and specifically SCP) protocol by reducing wait time in loop waiting for completion of a command from 1000ms to 50ms.   Fixed bug in SshInteractiveSudoOverthereConnection where it could not handle a password prompt that does not end in """"assword:"""" but has """"assword"""" somewhere in the middle.   Added CmdLine/CmdLineArgument abstraction of command line to allow for better hiding of passwords in logs and implement command line encoding (moved here from from OperatingSystemFamily).   Improved Over   Reimplemented OverthereConnection.execute() in terms of OverthereConnection.startProcess(): reduces duplicate code in protocol implementations  ensures execute() and startProcess() have identical semantics  and forces all protocol implementations to implement startProcess() so that the WSADMIN and WLST daemons will always work.   Set source and target compatibility to 1.6.   Added building of sources (and javadoc once artifacts.gradle is fixed).   Added dependency on Guava. Should replace all use of Apache Commons soon.   Using Scannit for annotation scanning instead of Reflections.   Updated notes in README.md. ",rename,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JCBC 940: Rename subdoc builder doXXX methods to execute()  Motivation:             The original RFC method name for execution of a builder is do(). This is incompatible eg. with Java  being a keyword. Most other SDKs where this is also incompatible elected to name the method execute() instead.  Since it is expected that the RFC be amended towards renaming execute()  the java naming of doMutate() and doLookup() can be harmonized with the other SDKs.  Modifications:                doMutate() and doLookup() are now all renamed execute().  Results:          The execution methods of the builders are the same across SDKs where do cannot be a method name.

"Enhancements to how queries with bind values are stored internally and sent to the server.  Previously we allocated a new String object for the entire final query we were sending to the database.  If you had a big query  or especially if you had large bind values you ended up with essentially two copies in memory. This change will reuse the existing objects and therefore should take 1/2 the memory it does today for a given query.  This restructuring will also allow in the future the ability to stream bytea data to the server instead of the current approach of pulling it all into memory.

JCBC 985: Fix fts errors handling/parsing  querystring  highlight  Motivation            During the REVIEW phase  the following problems have been identified with FTS RFC that affect the implementation:     StringQuery should be QueryStringQuery    there is an additional plaintext error case: HTTP 412 when a  consistency is requested but cannot be fulfilled within the timeout    highlight style is actually optional    errors is not an array but an object  and when it is present  hits  can be null  Modifications                  StringQuery has been renamed to QueryStringQuery  and the static  factory method from string to queryString.    highlight now has several overloads that can omit the style. when  used  the style is actually set to new special enum SERVER_DEFAULT.    HTTP 412 case leads to a ResponseStatus.FAILURE  which is now  interpreted as a FtsConsistencyTimeoutException    HTTP 200 with execution errors now parses both a JsonArray and a  JsonObject. The case where hits is null is also handled.  Added unit tests and integration tests  most notably for the error handling cases.  Result        The error handling of FTS is more correct (and a bug with it is fixed). Other comments from rfc review have been taken into account.

"Clarification of the matrix assignment package  remove methods getNumberOfWorkersRows() and getNumberOfWorkersColumns() of the MatrixAssignment interface. They were only present for printing and they made no sense in that a partition can have distinct number of workers on different rows (for example in Modification3).  To allow the printing of a MatrixAssignment  the method toString() has been overloaded in both OptimalPartition and EquiMatrixAssignment.  The method verifyValidity() in Partition has been rename to valid() to be Java friendly.  The parameter of the method getRegions has been changed from """"isSRelation"""" to """"dimension"""" to be consistent with the implemented interface.  Some comments have been added to the MatrixMapping package. ",rename,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fixing the API for network registration so we can register without having to have a reference to the whole NetworkController object.

"Initial restructuring to add jdbc3 support.  There was a significant amount of duplicated code between the jdbc1 and jdbc2.  This checkin restructures the code so that the duplication is removed so that the jdbc3 support can be added without adding yet another copy of everything.

"JCBC 748: join/nest key clause uses ON KEYS syntax  Motivation            In N1QL  the correct syntax for a on keys clause in a NEST or JOIN is """"ON KEYS Expression"""" not """"KEYS Expression"""" as currently implemented.  Also there s a clause that uses KEYS keyword  but differently: when referencing primary keys (document IDs)  the """"USE KEYS"""" syntax should be used. This syntax expects strings or array of strings (not a token). Could be implemented as a useKeys(...) method next to the current keys methods.  Modifications               KeysElement now takes an enum to denote the type of KEYS clause.  KeysPath """"keys"""" methods for the JOIN side of things have been renamed to """"onKeys""""  added """"useKeys"""" for the FROM side of things (referencing a primary key).  onKeys and useKeys accept an array of Strings. UseKeys with array of size 1 will only produce a String in query  not a JSON array.  Refactored unit tests where ON KEYS was expected. Modified unit tests where USE KEYS what meant instead of ON KEYS.  Results         All unit tests passing  one can now do a FROM clause on the primary key  using useKeys(...) methods. The syntax for JOINs key clause has been fixed in onKeys(...) methods.

JCBC 665: n1ql dp4 Refactor Query into Statement  Motivation            In dp4 queries are not just a string from the query language  but they can have additional parameters. The current implementation just assume there s no other relevant parameter. We need to introduce the concept of a Statement (the current Query dsl) and allow to construct queries with either just a Statement  or with parameters (positional or named).  Modifications               What follows are BREAKING CHANGES:  Refactored Query class into Statement class (including in tests  vars  javadoc). As a side effect  fixed the references to Query in javadoc of SpatialViewQuery and ViewQuery.  The Query interface now represents a complete N1QL dp4 query  that is a Statement and some other params. Such queries are sent to the server by transforming them into Json (the N1QL server accepts Json body in POST for queries). Three implementations have been added: SimpleQuery replaces the use of Query in previous versions  while ParametrizedQuery and PreparedQuery allow to fill values for positional or named parameters in a Statement.  Previous methods query(String s) on buckets have been removed. Ad hoc querying is still possible by providing a complete json representation of the query  parameters and all included  through the queryRaw method.  The equivalent of previous query(Query q) method is now query(Statement s) as the original Query interface has been renamed to Statement.  GenericQueryRequest has been refactored in core to use factory methods to distinguish between a simple statement and a full json query. The latest is now in use in CouchbaseAsyncBucket.  Added tests for the construction of N1QL json from various Queries.  Result        User now construct Statements using the DSL  that they use in a Query. These conforms better to the dp4 specification of N1QL querying  and will ultimately allow for optional and named parameters to be used.

Merge the virtualBiomes and ReplaceToBiomeName features into one  To do this  I had to rewrite a lot of code  which is why this task  that sounds simple  was actually quite complicated.  We want ReplaceToBiomeName to change the savedId. This setting is read after the LocalBiome instance was created and indexed. Postponing the creation of the LocalBiome instance also wasn t an option  as the BiomeConfig requires it to create the default settings.  The solution to this was to split LocalBiome into two classes: one  still called LocalBiome  holds name and id of the biome  and one called MojangSettings holds the default settings. The MojangSettings instance is created before the biome is loaded  the LocalBiome instance is created after.  BiomeConfigs don t depend on the LocalBiome instance anymore  it s now the other way round: LocalBiome holds a BiomeConfig instance. Most of the code now looks nicer thanks to this change. Unfortunately  the biome generation code didn t really improve  as it does a lot of id based lookups.  Custom biomes don t need a MojangSettings instance to be created  as no settings from Mojang are used for custom biomes.  The registry in StandardBiomeFactory has been removed  it s now DefaultBiome s job to create it. StandardBiomeFactory has been renamed to StandardBiomeTemplate  and StandardMinecraftBiomes has been renamed MinecraftBiomeTemplates  a class that holds subclasses of MinecraftBiomeTemplate.  The concept of NullBiome s is gone. Now that LocalBiome instances are no longer required to create BiomeConfigs  the settings can be checked without creating a nonoperational LocalBiome implementation.,rename,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Rework test and rename it to testGetEpisodeTitle.  The old test """"testDownloadAndRename"""" didn t do any renaming (so  ironically  it s being renamed!).  What it does is lookup a show by its name  and once that s done  look up an episode by its season and episode numbers.  It also used to parse a filename to extract those pieces of information  but that was redundant.  That s exactly what the method testParseFileName does  and testParseFileName does it better.  So  eliminate the redundancy.  Instead of having it re parse the file name  we now just use the values already provided for show name  season  and episode.  This allows us to eliminate the filename and the expected resolution from the input  as they are irrelevant for this test. ",rename,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rename two argument remove() methods in MultiHashMap and MultiIdentityHashMap for java 8.  In java 8 there is a method of the same name but different signature on Map. So these classes don t compile on java 8.  Renamed as removeMapping()  which is the same name used by apache collections which faced a similar problem.  Note that the resulting map tiles are different when using java 7 and java 8. At least some of this appears to be due to different iteration order in maps  but there may be more serious problems   I don t know.  git svn id: http://svn.mkgmap.org.uk/mkgmap/trunk@3314 25d90789 57f7 4ee0 8453 03a3dfeeeb22,rename,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Replaced the """"delete rename add"""" style of prototype trickery with prototype flattening trickery.  The previous mechanism was running into strange problems with duplicate entity names  and it did not support multiple database types using the same set of prototypes (i.e. EOJDBCFrontBasePrototypes + EOJDBCPostgresPrototypes in the same app).  In the new system  any model that declares and EOPrototypeEntityName (either explicitly with Wonder properties or with Entity Modeler) will have its prototyped attributes flattened at runtime.  You can disable this behavior by setting er.extensions.ERXModelGroup.flattenPrototypes to false.  If you do this  though  you will lose all support for explicitly setting prototype entities and it will fall back to the stock behavior.

Drop the use of HBase rowlocks for record creates. Fixes  225.  * Exceptions during wal.processMessage were logged in case of create but not update  both are now logged (because they are the same code).  * I renamed the method putMessageOnWalAndProcess to putRowWithWalProcessing  since with the former it was not obvious that this method was doing the put of the row itself.  * The metric for HBaseAction.PUT is not reported anymore. It was only reported for create  not for update or updateMutableFields. Should be readded if of interest.   git svn id: svn+ssh://dev.outerthought.org/outerthought/lilyproject/trunk@4637 b80d95f8 e103 0410 bd55 e03a9dc29394,rename,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"JCBC 926: Drop the named prefix in primary index management  Motivation:             Method to deal with named primary indexes in previous JCBC 926 change had the """"Named"""" prefix (eg. createNamedPrimaryIndex)  which is redundant and can be dropped (these methods then becoming simple overloads of the existing xxxPrimaryIndex methods).  Modification:               Renamed createNamedPrimaryIndex methods to createPrimaryIndex (overload) and dropNamedPrimaryIndex to dropPrimaryIndex.  Results:          Dealing with default named or custom named primary indexes is now just done through overloaded methods  simplifying the API.

Make ConfigFunction code easier to use     Instance state and the init method Previously  there was all kinds of complex state in the ConfigFunction instance. Now all required arguments are provided in the constructor of a ConfigFunction. The init method is gone.     Error handling Previously  if the init method threw an InvalidConfigException  the instance would be kept. Now such invalid instances are no longer kept  an instance of ErroredFunction is used instead. The getError and isValid methods have been removed.     Reflection code There s still some relfection code involved  as we need a way to go from for example PlantGen.class to a PlantGen instance. If we would use Java 8  we could use the newer PlantGen::new syntax to get a reference to the constructor of PlantGen.     makeString() The ConfigFunction.makeString() method has been renamed to the more conventional toString(). The ConfigFunction.write() wrapper method has been removed.     getHolderType() This method has been removed. Checking for the holder type now happens by checking for which constructors exist.,rename,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
